<p>Our next job was to man the port-braces
and bring the ship to a westerly course.
But before we went to this work the boatswain
and I stood for some minutes looking
at the appearance of the sky.</p>

<p>The range of cloud which had been but
a low-lying and apparently a fugitive bank
in the north-west at midnight, was now so
far advanced as to project nearly over our
heads, and what rendered its aspect more
sinister was the steely colour of the sky,
which it ruled with a line, here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
rugged, but for the most part singularly
even, right from the confines of the north-eastern
to the limits of the south-western
horizon. All the central portion of this
vast surface of cloud was of a livid hue,
which, by a deception of the eye, made it
appear convex, and at frequent intervals a
sharp shower of arrowy lightning whizzed
from that portion of it furthest away from
us, but as yet we could hear no thunder.</p>

<p>"When the rain before the wind, then
your topsail halliards mind," chaunted the
boatswain. "There's rather more nor a
quarter o' an inch o' rain there, and there's
something worse nor rain astern of it."</p>

<p>The gloomiest feature of this approaching
tempest, if such it were, was the slowness,
at once mysterious and impressive, of its
approach.</p>

<p>I was not, however, to be deceived by
this into supposing that, because it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
taken nearly all night to climb the horizon,
there was no wind behind it. I had had
experience of a storm of this kind, and
remembered the observations of one of the
officers of the ship, when speaking of it.
"Those kind of storms," he said, "are not
driven by wind, but create it. They keep a
hurricane locked up in their insides, and
wander across the sea, on the look-out for
ships; when they come across something
worth wrecking they let fly. Don't be
deceived by their slow pace, and imagine
them only thunderstorms. They'll burst
like an earthquake in a dead calm over
your head, and whenever you see one
coming snug your ship right away down to
the last reef in her, and keep your stern
at it."</p>

<p>"I am debating, bo'sun," said I, "whether
to bring the ship round or keep her before
it. What do you think?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
"There's a gale of wind there. I can
smell it," he replied; "but we're snug
enough to lie close, aren't we?" looking up
at the masts.</p>

<p>"That's to be proved," said I. "We'll
bring her close if you like; but I'm pretty
sure we shall have to run for it later on."</p>

<p>"It'll bowl us well away into mid-Atlantic,
won't it, Mr. Royle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I wish we were more to the
norrard of Bermudas. However, we'll
tackle the yards, and have a try for the
tight little islands."</p>

<p>"They're pretty nigh all rocks, aren't
they? I never sighted 'em."</p>

<p>"Nor I. But they've got a dockyard at
Bermuda, I believe, where the Yankees refit
sometimes, and that's about all I know of
those islands."</p>

<p>I asked Miss Robertson to put the helm
down and keep it there until the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
pointed west; but the ship had so little
way upon her, owing to the small amount of
canvas she carried now and the faintness of
the wind, that it took her as long to come
round as if we had been warping her head
to the westwards by a buoy.</p>

<p>Having braced up the yards and steadied
the helm, we could do no more; and resolving
to profit as much as possible from the
interval of rest before us, I directed Cornish
to take the wheel, and ordered the steward
to go forward and light the galley fire and
boil some coffee for breakfast.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," said I, "you might as well
drop below and have a look at those plugs
of yours. Take a hammer with you and
this light," handing him the binnacle lamp,
"and drive the plugs in hard, for if the
ship should labour heavily, she might strain
them out."</p>

<p>He started on his errand, and I then told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Miss Robertson that there was nothing
now to detain her on deck, and thanked
her for the great services she had rendered
us.</p>

<p>How well I remember her as she stood
near the wheel, wearing my straw hat, her
dress hitched up to allow freedom to her
movements; her small hands with the delicate
blue veins glowing through the white
clear skin, her yellow hair looped up, though
with many a tress straying like an amber-coloured
feather; her marble face, her lips
pale with fatigue, her beautiful blue eyes
fired ever with the same brave spirit,
though dim with the weariness of long and
painful watching and the oppressive and
numbing sense of ever-present danger.</p>

<p>On no consideration would I allow her to
remain any longer on deck, and though she
begged to stay, I took her hand firmly, and
led her into the cuddy to her cabin door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
"You will faithfully promise me to lie
down and sleep?" I said.</p>

<p>"I will lie down, and will sleep if I can,"
she answered, with a wan smile.</p>

<p>"We have succeeded in saving you so
far," I continued, earnestly, "and it would
be cruel, very cruel, and hard upon me, to
see your health break down for the want of
rest and sleep, when both are at your command,
now that life is bright again, and
when any hour may see us safe on the deck
of another vessel."</p>

<p>"You shall not suffer through me," she
replied. "I will obey you, indeed I will
do anything you want."</p>

<p>I kissed her hand respectfully, and said
that a single hour of sound sleep would do
her a deal of good; by that time I would
take care that breakfast should be ready for
her and her father, and I then held open
the cabin door for her to enter, and returned
on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
A most extraordinary and wonderful sight
saluted me when I reached the poop.</p>

<p>The sun had risen behind the vast embankment
of cloud, and its glorious rays,
the orb itself being invisible, projected in
a thousand lines of silver beyond the margin
of the bank to the right and overhead,
jutting out in visible threads, each as defined
as a sunbeam in a dark room.</p>

<p>But the effect of this wonderful light was
to render the canopy of cloud more horribly
livid; and weird and startling was the contrast
of the mild and far-reaching sunshine,
streaming in lines of silver brightness into
the steely sky, with the blue lightning
ripping up the belly of the cloud and
suffering the eye to dwell for an instant
on the titanic strata of gloom that stood
ponderously behind.</p>

<p>Nor was the ocean at this moment a
less sombre and majestical object than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
heavens; for upon half of it rested a shadow
deep as night, making the water sallow and
thick, and most desolate to behold under
the terrible curtain that lay close down to
it upon the horizon; whilst all on the right
the green sea sparkled in the sunbeams,
heaving slowly under the calm that had
fallen.</p>

<p>Looking far away on the weather beam,
and where the shadow on the sea was
deepest, I fancied that I discerned a black
object, which might well be a ship with her
sails darkened by her distance from the
sun.</p>

<p>I pointed it out to Cornish, who saw it
too, and I then fetched the telescope.</p>

<p>Judge of my surprise and consternation,
when the outline of a boat with her sail low
down on the mast, entered the field of the
glass! I cried out, "It's the long-boat!"</p>

<p>Cornish turned hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
"My God!" he cried, "they're doomed
men!"</p>

<p>I gazed at her intently, but could not be
deceived, for I recognised the cut of the
stu'nsail, lowered as it was in anticipation
of the breaking of the storm, and I could
also make out the minute dark figures of the
men in her.</p>

<p>My surprise, however, was but momentary,
for, considering the lightness of the
wind that had prevailed all night, and the
probability of her having stood to and fro in
expectation of coming across us, or the
quarter-boat which had attacked us, I had
no reason to expect that they should have
been far off.</p>

<p>The boatswain came along the quarterdeck
singing out, "It's all right below! No
fear of a leak there!"</p>

<p>"Come up here!" I cried. "There's
the long-boat yonder!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
On hearing this, he ran aft as hard as
he could and stared in the direction I indicated,
but could not make her out until
he had the glass to his eye, on which he
<span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Yes, it's her, sure enough. Why, we
may have to make another fight for it.
She's heading this way, and if she brings
down any wind, by jingo she'll overhaul us."</p>

<p>"No, no," I answered. "They're not for
fighting. They don't like the look of the
weather, bo'sun, and would board us to save
their lives, not to take ours."</p>

<p>"That's it, sir," exclaimed Cornish. "I
reckon there's little enough mutineering
among 'em now Stevens is gone. I'd lay
my life they'd turn to and go to work just
as I have if you'd lay by for 'em and take
'em in."</p>

<p>Neither the boatswain nor I made any
reply to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
For my own part, though we had been
perishing for the want of more hands, I
don't think I should have had trust enough
in those rascals to allow them on board; for
I could not doubt that when the storm was
over, and they found themselves afloat in
the <i>Grosvenor</i> once more, they would lay
violent hands upon me and the boatswain,
and treat us as they had treated Coxon and
Duckling, revenging themselves in this way
upon us for the death of Stevens and the
other leaders of the mutiny, and likewise
protecting themselves against their being
carried to England and handed over to
the authorities on shore as murderers.</p>

<p>The lightning was now growing very
vivid, and for the first time I heard the
sullen moan of thunder.</p>

<p>"That means," said the boatswain, "that
it's a good bit off yet; and if that creature
forrard 'll only bear a hand we shall be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to get something to eat and drink afore it
comes down."</p>

<p>However, as he spoke, the steward came
aft with a big coffee-pot. He set it on the
skylight, and fetched from the pantry some
good preserved meat, biscuit and butter,
and we fell to the repast with great relish
and hunger.</p>

<p>Being the first to finish, I took the wheel
while Cornish breakfasted, and then ordered
the steward to go and make some fresh
coffee, and keep it hot in the galley, and
prepare a good breakfast for the Robertsons
ready to serve when the young lady should
leave her cabin.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," said I, as he came slowly towards
me, filling his pipe, "I don't like the
look of that mainsail. It 'll blow out and
kick up a deuce of a shindy. You and
Cornish had better lay aloft with some
spare line and serve the sail with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
"That's soon done," he answered, cheerfully.
And Cornish left his breakfast, and
they both went aloft.</p>

<p>I yawned repeatedly as I stood at the
wheel, and my eyes were sore for want of
sleep.</p>

<p>But there was something in the aspect of
that tremendous, stooping, quarter-sphere
of cloud abeam of us, throwing a darkness
most sinister to behold on half the sea, and
vomiting quick lances of blue fire from its
caverns, while now and again the thunder
rolled solemnly, which was formidable
enough to keep me wide awake.</p>

<p>It was growing darker every moment:
already the sun's beams were obscured,
though that portion of the great canopy of
cloud which lay nearest to the luminary
carried still a flaming edge.</p>

<p>A dead calm had fallen, and the ship
rested motionless on the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The two men remained for a short time
on the main-yard, and then came down,
leaving the sail much more secure than
they had found it. Cornish despatched his
breakfast, and the boatswain came to me.</p>

<p>"Do you see the long-boat now, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "she's hidden in the
rain yonder. By Heaven! it <i>is</i> coming
down!"</p>

<p>I did not exaggerate; the horizon was
grey with the rain: it looked like steam
rising from a boiling sea.</p>

<p>"It 'll keep 'em busy bailing," said the
boatswain.</p>

<p>"Hold on here," I cried, "till I get my
oilskins."</p>

<p>I was back again in a few moments, and
he went away to drape himself for the
downfall, and to advise Cornish to do the
same.</p>

<p>I left the wheel for a second or two to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
close one of the skylights, and as I did so a
flash of lightning seemed to set the ship on
fire, and immediately came a deafening
crash of thunder. I think there is something
more awful in the roar of thunder
heard at sea than on shore, unless you are
among mountains; you get the full intensity
of it, the mighty outburst smiting
the smooth surface of the water, which in
itself is a wonderful vehicle of sound, and
running onwards for leagues without meeting
with any impediment to check or
divert it.</p>

<p>I hastened to see if the lightning conductor
ran clear to the water, and finding
the end of the wire coiled up in the port
main-chains, flung it overboard and resumed
my place at the wheel.</p>

<p>Now that the vast surface of cloud was
well forward of overhead, I observed that
its front was an almost perfect semicircle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the extremities at either point of the horizon
projecting like horns. There still remained,
embraced by these horns, a clear expanse of
steel-coloured sky. <i>There</i> the sea was light,
but all to starboard it was black, and the
terrible shadow was fast bearing down upon
the ship.</p>

<p>Crack! the lightning whizzed, and turned
the deck, spars, and rigging into a network
of blue fire. The peal that followed was a
sudden explosion&mdash;a great dead crash, as
though some mighty ponderous orb had
fallen from the highest heaven upon the
flooring of the sky and riven it.</p>

<p>Then I heard the rain.</p>

<p>I scarcely know which was the more
terrifying to see and hear&mdash;the rain, or the
thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>It was a cataract of water falling from a
prodigious elevation. It was a dense, impervious
liquid veil, shutting out all sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of sea and sky. It tore the water into
foam in striking it.</p>

<p>Then, <i>boom</i>! down it came upon us.</p>

<p>I held on by the wheel, and the boatswain
jammed himself under the grating.
It was not rain only&mdash;it was hail as big as
eggs; and the rain drops were as big as
eggs too.</p>

<p>There was not a breath of air. This
terrific fall came down in perfectly perpendicular
lines; and as the lightning rushed
through it, it illuminated with its ghastly
effulgence a broad sheet of water.</p>

<p>It was so dark that I could not see the
card in the binnacle. The water rushed off
our decks just as it would had we shipped
a sea. And for the space of twenty minutes
I stood stunned, deaf, blind, in the midst
of a horrible and overpowering concert of
pealing thunder and rushing rain, the awful
gloom being rendered yet more dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
by the dazzling flashes which passed
through it.</p>

<p>It passed as suddenly as it had come, and
left us still in a breathless calm, drenched,
terrified, and motionless.</p>

<p>It grew lighter to windward, and I felt a
small air blowing on my streaming face;
lighter still, though to leeward the storm
was raging and roaring, and passing with
its darkness like some unearthly night.</p>

<p>I squeezed the water out of my eyes, and
saw the wind come rushing towards us upon
the sea, whilst all overhead the sky was a
broad lead-coloured space.</p>

<p>"Now, bo'sun," I roared, "stand by!"</p>

<p>He came out from under the grating, and
took a grip of the rail.</p>

<p>"Here it comes!" he cried; "and by the
holy poker," he added, "here comes the
long-boat atop of it!"</p>

<p>I could only cast one brief glance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
direction indicated, where, sure enough, I
saw the long-boat flying towards us on a
surface of foam. In an instant the gale
struck the ship and over she heeled, laying
her port bulwark close down upon the water.
But there she stopped.</p>

<p>"Had we had whole topsails," I cried,
"it would have been Amen!"</p>

<p>I waited a moment or two before deciding
whether to put the helm up and run. If
this was the worst of it, the ship would do
as she was. But in that time the long-boat,
urged furiously forward by the sail they still
kept on her, passed close under our stern.
Twice, before she reached us, I saw them try
to bring her so as to come alongside, and
each time I held my breath, for I knew
that the moment they brought her broadside
to the wind she would capsize.</p>

<p>May God forbid that ever I should behold
such a sight again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
It was indescribably shocking to see
them swept helplessly past within hail of
us. There were seven men in her. Two
of them cried out and raved furiously,
entreating with dreadful, mad gesticulations
as they whirled past. But the rest,
some clinging to the mast, others seated
with their arms folded, were silent, like
dead men already, with fixed and staring
eyes&mdash;a ghastly crew. I saw one of the
two raving men spring on to the gunwale,
but he was instantly pulled down by
another.</p>

<p>But what was there to see? It was a
moment's horror&mdash;quick-vanishing as some
monstrous object leaping into sight under
a flash of lightning, then instantaneously
swallowed up in the devouring gloom.</p>

<p>Our ship had got way upon her, and was
surging forward with her lee-channels under
water. The long-boat dwindled away on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
our quarter, the spray veiling her as she
fled, and in a few minutes was not to be
distinguished upon the immeasurable bed of
foam and wave, stretching down to the livid
storm that still raged upon the far horizon.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Cornish, who
stood near the wheel unnoticed by me. "I
might ha' been in her! I might ha' been
in her!"</p>

<p>And he covered his face with his hands,
and sobbed and shook with the horror of
the scene, and the agony of the thoughts
it had conjured up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>I hardly knew what to make of the weather,
for though it blew very hard the wind was
not so violent as it had been during those
three days which I have written of in
another part of this story.</p>

<p>The ship managed to hold her own well,
with her head at west; I mean that she
went scraping through the water, making
very little lee-way, and so far she could
fairly well carry the three close-reefed topsails,
though I believe that had another yard
of canvas more than was already exposed
been on her, she would have lain down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
never righted again, so violent was the first
clap and outfly of the wind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I got the boatswain to take
the wheel, and sent Cornish forward to
stand by the fore-topsail sheets, whilst I
kept by the mizzen, for I was not at all
sure that the terrific thunder-storm that had
broken over us was not the precursor of a
hurricane, to come down at any moment on
the gale that was already blowing, and
wreck the ship out of hand.</p>

<p>In this way twenty minutes passed, when
finding the wind to remain steady, I sang
out to Cornish that he might come aft
again. As I never knew the moment when
a vessel might heave in sight I bent on the
small ensign and ran it half-way up at the
gaff end, not thinking it judicious to exhibit
a train of flag-signals in so much wind. I
then took the telescope, and, setting it
steady in the mizzen rigging, slowly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
carefully swept the weather horizon, and
afterwards transferred the glass to leeward,
but no ship was to be seen.</p>

<p>"We ought to be in the track o' some
sort o' wessels, too," exclaimed the boatswain,
who had been awaiting the result
of my inspections. "The steamers from
Liverpool to New Orleans, and the West
Indie mail-ships 'ud come right across this
way, wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so far north," I answered.
"But there ought to be no lack of sailing
ships from all parts&mdash;from England to the
southern ports of the United States and
North America&mdash;from American ports to
Rio and the eastern coast of South
America. They cannot keep us long
waiting. Something must heave in sight
soon."</p>

<p>"Suppose we sight a wessel, what do you
mean to do, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
"Ask them to let me have a few men to
work the ship to the nearest port."</p>

<p>"But suppose they're short-handed?"</p>

<p>"Then they won't oblige us."</p>

<p>"I can't see myself, sir," said he, "why,
instead o' tryin' to fetch Bermuda, we
shouldn't put the helm up and square away
for England. How might the English
Channel lie as we now are?"</p>

<p>"A trifle to the east'ard of north-east."</p>

<p>"Well, this here's a fair wind for it."</p>

<p>"That's true; but will you kindly remember
that the ship's company consists of
three men."</p>

<p>"Of four, countin' the steward, and five,
countin' Miss Robertson."</p>

<p>"Of three men, I say, capable of working
the vessel."</p>

<p>"Well, yes; you're right. Arter all,
there's only three to go aloft."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know," I continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
"that it would take a sailing ship, properly
manned, four or five weeks to make the
English Channel."</p>

<p>"Well, sir."</p>

<p>"Neither you, nor I, nor Cornish could
do without sleep for four or five weeks."</p>

<p>"We could keep regular watches, Mr.
Royle."</p>

<p>"I dare say we could; but we should
have to let the ship remain under reefed
topsails. But instead of taking four or five
weeks, we should take four or five months
to reach England under close-reefed topsails,
unless we could keep a gale of wind astern
of us all the way. I'll tell you what it is,
bo'sun, these exploits are very pretty, and
appear very possible in books, and persons
who take anything that is told them about
the sea as likely and true, believe they can
be accomplished. And on one or two
occasions they have been accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Also I have heard on one occasion a gentleman
made a voyage from Timor to Bathurst
Island on the back of a turtle. But
the odds, in my unromantic opinion, are a
thousand to one against our working the
ship home as we are, unless we can ship
a crew on the road, and very shortly. And
how can we be sure of this? There is
scarce a ship goes to sea now that is not
short-handed. We may sight fifty vessels,
and get no help from one of them. They
may all be willing to take us on board if
we abandon the <i>Grosvenor</i>; but they'll tell
us that they can give us no assistance to
work her. Depend upon it, our wisest
course is to make Bermuda. There, perhaps,
we may pick up some hands. But
if we head for England in this trim&mdash;a deep
ship, with heavy gear to work, and but
two seamen to depend upon, if the third has
to take the wheel, trusting to chance to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
us, I repeat that the odds against our bringing
the ship home are one thousand to one.
We shall be at the mercy of every gale
that rises, and end in becoming a kind of
phantom ship, chased about the ocean just
as the wind happens to blow us."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "I dare say you're
right, and I'll say no more about it. Now,
about turnin' in. I'll keep here if you like
to go below for a couple of hours. Cornish
can stand by to rouse you up."</p>

<p>I had another look to windward before
making up my mind to go below. A strong
sea was rising, and the wind blew hard
enough to keep one leaning against it.
There was no break in the sky, and the
horizon was thick, but the look-out was
not worse than it had been half an hour
before.</p>

<p>We were, however, snug enough aloft, if
not very neat; the bunt of the mainsail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
indeed, looked rather shaky, but the other
sails lay very secure upon the yards; and
this being so, and the gale remaining
steady, I told the boatswain to keep the
ship to her present course, and went below,
yawning horribly and dead wearied.</p>

<p>I had slept three-quarters of an hour,
when I was awakened by the steward rushing
into my cabin and hauling upon me like
a madman. Being scarcely conscious, I
imagined that the mutineers had got on
board again, and that here was one of them
falling upon me; and having sense enough,
I suppose, in my sleepy brain to make me
determine to sell my life at a good price, I
let fly at the steward's breast and struck
him so hard that he roared out, which sound
brought me to my senses at once.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," responded the steward, half
dead with terror and the loss of breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
occasioned by my blow, "the ship's sinking,
sir! We're all going down! I've been
told to fetch you up. The Lord have
mercy upon us!"</p>

<p>I rolled on to the deck in my hurry to
leave the bunk, and ran with all my speed
up the companion ladder; nor was the
ascent difficult, for the ship was on a level
keel, pitching heavily indeed, but rolling
slightly.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, was my head up
through the companion, when I thought it
would have been blown off my shoulders.
The fury and force of the wind was such
as I had never before in all my life experienced.</p>

<p>Both the boatswain and Cornish were at
the wheel, and, in order to reach them, I
had to drop upon my hands and knees and
crawl along the deck. When near them I
took a grip of the grating and looked around
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
The first thing I saw was that the mainsail
had blown away from most of the
gaskets, and was thundering in a thousand
rags upon the yard. The foresail was split
in halves, and the port mizzen-topsail sheet
had carried away, and the sail was pealing
like endless discharges of musketry.</p>

<p>All the spars were safe still. The lee
braces had been let go, the helm put up,
and the ship was racing before a hurricane
as furious as a tornado, heading south-east,
with a wilderness of foam boiling under her
bows.</p>

<p>This, then, was the real gale which the
thunder-storm had been nearly all night
bringing up. The first gale was but a
summer breeze compared to it.</p>

<p>The clouds lay like huge fantastic rolls of
sheet lead upon the sky; in some quarters
of the circle drooping to the water-line in
patches and spaces ink-black. No fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of blue heaven was visible; and yet it
was lighter than it had been when I went
below.</p>

<p>The ensign, half-masted, roared over my
head; the sea was momentarily growing
heavier, and, as the ship pitched, she took
the water in broad sheets over her forecastle.</p>

<p>The terrible beating of the mizzen-topsail
was making the mizzen-mast, from the
mastcoat to the royal mast-head, jump like a
piece of whalebone. Although deafened,
bewildered, and soaked through with the
screaming of the gale, the thunder of the
torn canvas, and the spray which the wind
tore out of the sea and hurtled through the
air, I still preserved my senses; and perceiving
that the mizzen-topmast would go
if the sail were not got rid of, I crawled on
my hands and knees to the foot of the mast,
and let go the remaining sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
With appalling force, and instantaneously,
the massive chain was torn
through the sheave-hole, and in less time
than I could have counted ten, one half the
sail had blown into the main-top, and the
rest streamed like the ends of whipcord
from the yard.</p>

<p>I crawled to the fore-end of the poop to
look at the mainmast; that stood steady;
but whilst I watched the foremast, the foresail
went to pieces, and the leaping and
plunging of the heavy blocks upon it made
the whole mast quiver so violently that the
top-gallant and royal-mast bent to and fro
like a bow strung and unstrung quickly.</p>

<p>I waited some moments, debating
whether or not to let go the fore-topsail
sheets; but reflecting that the full force of
the wind was kept away from it by the
main-topsail, and that it would certainly
blow to pieces if I touched a rope belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
to it, I dropped on my hands and knees
again and crawled away aft.</p>

<p>"I saw it coming!" roared the bo'sun in
my ear. "I had just time to sing out to
Cornish to slacken the lee-braces, and to
put the helm hard over."</p>

<p>"We shall never be able to run!" I
bellowed back. "She'll be pooped as sure
as a gun when the sea comes! We must
heave her to whilst we can. No use
thinking of the fore-topsail&mdash;it must go!"</p>

<p>"Look there!" shouted Cornish, dropping
the spokes with one hand to point.</p>

<p>There was something indeed to look at;
one of the finest steamers I had ever seen,
brig-rigged, hove to under a main-staysail.
She seemed, so rapidly were we reeling
through the water, to rise out of the sea.</p>

<p>She lay with her bowsprit pointing across
our path, just on our starboard bow.
Lying as she was, without way on her, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
should have run into her had the weather
been thick, as surely as I live to say so.</p>

<p>We slightly starboarded the helm, clearing
her by the time we were abreast by not
more than a quarter of a mile. But we
dared not have hauled the ship round
another point; for, with our braces all loose,
the first spilling of the sails would have
brought the yards aback, in which case
indeed we might have called upon God to
have mercy on our souls, for the ship would
not have lived five minutes.</p>

<p>There was something fascinating in the
spectacle of that beautiful steamship, rolling
securely in the heavy sea, revealing as she
went over to starboard her noble graceful
hull, to within a few feet of her keel. But
there was also something unspeakably
dreadful to us to see help so close at hand,
and yet of no more use than had it offered
a thousand miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
There was a man on her bridge, and
others doubtless watched our vessel unseen
by us; and God knows what sensations
must have been excited in them by the
sight of our torn and whirling ship blindly
rushing before the tempest, her sails in
rags, the half-hoisted ensign bitterly illustrating
our miserable condition, and appealing,
with a power and pathos no human cry
could express, for help which could not be
given.</p>

<p>"Let us try and heave her to now!" I
shrieked, maddened by the sight of this ship
whirling fast away on our quarter. "We
can lie by her until the gale has done and
then she will help us!"</p>

<p>But the boatswain could not control the
wheel alone: the blows of the sea against
the rudder made it hard for even four pairs
of hands to hold the wheel steady. I
rushed to the companion and bawled for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
steward, and when, after a long pause, he
emerged, no sooner did the wind hit him
than he rolled down the ladder.</p>

<p>I sprang below, hauled him up by the
collar of his jacket, and drove him with
both hands to his stern up to the wheel.</p>

<p>"Hold on to these spokes!" I roared.
And then Cornish and I ran staggering
along the poop.</p>

<p>"Get the end of the starboard main-brace
to the capstan!" I cried to him. "Look
alive! ship one of the bars ready!"</p>

<p>And then I scrambled as best I could
down on the main-deck, and went floundering
forward through the water that was now
washing higher than my ankle to the fore-topsail
halliards, which I let go.</p>

<p>Crack! whiz! away went the sail, strips
of it flying into the sea like smoke.</p>

<p>I struggled back again on to the poop,
but the violence of the wind was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
more than I could bear: it beat the breath
out of me; it stung my face just as if it
were filled with needles; it roared in my
ears; it resembled a solid wall; it rolled me
off my knees and hands, and obliged me to
drag myself against it bit by bit, by whatever
came in my road to hold on to.</p>

<p>Cornish lay upon the deck with the end
of the main-brace in his hands, having taken
the necessary turns with it around the
capstan.</p>

<p>I laid my weight against the bar and
went to work, and scrambling and panting,
beaten half dead by the wind, and no more
able to look astern without protecting my
eyes with my hands than I could survey
any object in a room full of blinding smoke,
I gradually got the mainyard round, but
found I had not the strength to bring it
close to the mast.</p>

<p>I saw the boatswain speak to the steward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
who left the wheel to help me with his
weight against the capstan bar.</p>

<p>I do think at that moment that the boatswain
transformed himself into an immovable
figure of iron. Heaven knows
from what measureless inner sources he procured
the temporary strength: he clenched
his teeth, and the muscles in his hands rose
like bulbs as he hung to the wheel and
pitted his strength against the blows of the
seas upon the rudder.</p>

<p>Brave, honest fellow! a true seaman, a
true Englishman! Well would it be for
sailors were there more of his kind among
them to set them examples of honest labour,
noble self-sacrifice, and duty ungrudgingly
performed!</p>

<p>The seas struck the ship heavily as she
rounded to. I feared that she would have
too much head-sail to lie close, for the
foresail and fore-topsail were in ribbons&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
might show enough roaring canvas
when coupled with the fore-topmast staysail
to make her pay off, we having no after-sail
set to counterbalance the effect of them.</p>

<p>However, she lay steady, that is, as the
compass goes, but rolled fearfully, wallowing
deep like a ship half full of water, and
shipped such tremendous seas that I constantly
expected to hear the crash of the
galley stove in.</p>

<p>I now shaded my eyes to look astern; not
hoping, indeed, to see the steamer near, but
expecting at least to find her in sight. But
the horizon was a dull blank: not a sign
of the vessel to be seen, nothing but the
rugged line of water, and the nearer deep
dark under the shadow of the leaden pouring
clouds.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p>In bringing the ship close to the wind in
this terrible gale, without springing a spar,
we had done what I never should have
believed practicable to four men, taking
into consideration the size of the ship and
the prodigious force of the wind; and when
I looked aloft and considered that only a
few hours before, so to speak, the ship was
carrying all the sail that could be put upon
her, and that three men had stripped her of
it and put her under a close-reefed main-topsail
fit to encounter a raging hurricane,
I could not help thinking that we had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
right to feel proud of our endurance and
spirit.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty now in holding
the wheel, and, had no worse sea than was
now running been promised us, the helm
might have been lashed and the vessel lain
as comfortably as a smack with her foresail
over to windward.</p>

<p>The torn sails were making a hideous
noise on the yards forward, and as there was
no earthly reason why this clamour should
be suffered to last, I called to Cornish to
get his knife ready and help me to cut the
canvas away from the jackstays. We
hauled the braces taut to steady the yards,
and then went aloft, and in ten minutes
severed the fragments of the foresail and
topsail, and they blew up into the air like
paper, and were carried nearly half a mile
before they fell into the sea.</p>

<p>The wind was killing up aloft, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
heartily glad to get on deck again, not only
to escape the wind, but on account of the
fore-topmast and top-gallant mast, both of
which had been heavily tried, and now
rocked heavily as the ship rolled, and
threatened to come down with the weight
of the yards upon them.</p>

<p>But neither Cornish nor I had strength
enough in us to stay the masts more
securely; our journey aloft and our sojourn
on the yards, and our fight with the wind
to maintain our hold, had pretty well done
for us; and in Cornish I took notice of that
air of lassitude and dull indifference which
creeps upon shipwrecked men when worn
out with their struggles, and which resembles
in its way the stupor which falls
upon persons who are perishing of cold.</p>

<p>It was fair, however, since I had had
some rest, that I should now take a spell at
the wheel, and I therefore told Cornish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
go to the cabin lately occupied by Stevens,
the ship's carpenter, and turn in, and then
crawled aft to the poop and desired the
boatswain to go below and rest himself, and
order the steward, who had not done one-tenth
of the work we had performed, to
stand by ready to come on deck if I should
call to him.</p>

<p>I was now alone on deck, in the centre,
so it seemed when looking around the horizon,
of a great storm, which was fast lifting
the sea into mountains.</p>

<p>I took a turn round the spokes of the
wheel and secured the tiller ropes to steady
the helm, and held on, crouching to windward,
so that I might get some shelter from
the murderous force of the wind by the
slanting deck and rail.</p>

<p>I could better now realize our position
than when at work, and the criticalness of it
struck and awed me like a revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
I cast my eyes upon the main-topsail, and
inspected it anxiously, as on this sail our
lives might depend. If it blew away the
only sail remaining would be the fore-topmast
staysail. In all probability the ship's
head would at once pay off, let me keep
the helm jammed down as hard as I
pleased; the vessel would then drive before
the seas, which, as she had not enough
canvas on her to keep her running at any
speed, would very soon topple over her
stern, sweep the decks fore and aft, and
render her unmanageable.</p>

<p>There was likewise the further danger of
the fore-topmast going, the whole weight of
the staysail being upon it. If this went it
would take that sail with it, and the ship
would round into the wind's eye and drive
away astern.</p>

<p>Had there been more hands on board I
should not have found these speculations so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
alarming. My first job would have been to
get some of the cargo out of the hold and
pitch it overboard, so as to lighten the ship,
for the dead weight in her made her strain
horribly. Then with men to help it would
have been easy to get the storm trysail on if
the topsail blew away, clap preventer backstays
on to the foremast and fore-topmast,
and rouse them taut with tackles, and send
down the royal and top-gallant yards, so as
to ease the masts of the immense leverage
of these spars.</p>

<p>But what could four men do&mdash;one of the
four being almost useless, and all four exhausted
not by the perils and labour of the
storm only, but by the fight they had had
to make for their lives against fellow-beings?</p>

<p>Alone on deck, with the heavy seas
splashing and thundering, and precipitating
their volumes of water over the ship's side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
with the gale howling and roaring through
the skies, I grew bitterly despondent. It
seemed as if God Himself were against me,
that I was the sport of some remorseless
fate, whereby I was led from one peril to
another, from one suffering to another, and
no mercy to be shown me until death gave
me rest.</p>

<p>And yet I was sensible of no revolt and
inward rage against what I deemed my
destiny. My being and individuality were
absorbed and swallowed up in the power
and immensity of the tempest, like a rain-drop
in the sea. I was overwhelmed by the
vastness of the dangers which surrounded
me, by the sense of the littleness and insignificance
of myself and my companions in
the midst of this spacious theatre of
warring winds, and raging seas, and far-reaching
sky of pouring cloud. I felt as
though all the forces of nature were directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
against my life; and those cries which my
heart would have sent up in the presence of
dangers less tumultuous and immense were
silenced by a kind of dull amazement, of
heavy passive bewilderment, which numbed
my mind and forced upon me an indifference
to the issue without depriving me
of the will and energy to avert it.</p>

<p>I held my post at the wheel, being
anxious that the boatswain and Cornish
should recruit their strength by sleep, for if
one or the other of them broke down, then,
indeed, our case would be deplorable.</p>

<p>The force of the wind was stupendous,
and yet the brave main-topsail stood it; but
not an hour had passed since the two men
went below when a monster wave took the
ship on the starboard bow and threw her
up, rolling at the same time an immense
body of water on to the decks; her stern,
where I was crouching, sank in the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
level with the sea, then as the leviathan
wave rolled under her counter, the ship's
bows fell into a prodigious trough with a
sickening, whirling swoop. Ere she could
recover, another great sea rolled right upon
her, burying her forecastle, and rushing with
the fury of a cataract along the main-deck.</p>

<p>Another wave of that kind, and our fate
was sealed.</p>

<p>But happily these were exceptional seas;
smaller waves succeeded, and the struggling,
straining ship showed herself alive
still.</p>

<p>Alive, but maimed. That tremendous
swoop had carried away the jibboom, and
the fore top-gallant mast&mdash;the one close
against the bowsprit head, the other a few
inches above the top-gallant yard. The
mast, with the royal yard upon it, hung all
in a heap against the fore-topmast, but
fortunately kept steady, owing to the yard-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>arm
having jammed itself into the fore-topmast
rigging. The jibboom was clean
gone adrift and was washing away to leeward.</p>

<p>This was no formidable accident, though
it gave the ship a wrecked and broken look.
I should have been well-pleased to see all
three top-gallant masts go over the side, for
the weight of the yards, swaying to and fro
at great angles, was too much for the lower-masts,
and not only strained the decks, but
the planking to which the chain-plates were
bolted.</p>

<p>My great anxiety now was for the fore-topmast,
which was sustaining the weight
of the broken mast and yard, in addition
to the top-gallant yard, still standing, and
the heavy pulling of the fore-topmast staysail.</p>

<p>Dreading the consequences that might
follow the loss of this sail, I called to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
steward at the top of my voice, and on his
thrusting his head up the companion, I
bade him rouse up Cornish and the boatswain,
and send them on deck.</p>

<p>In a very short time they both arrived,
and the boatswain, on looking forward, immediately
comprehended our position and
anticipated my order.</p>

<p>"The topmast 'll go!" he roared in my
ear. "Better let go the staysail-halliards,
and make a short job o' it."</p>

<p>"Turn to and do it at once," I replied.
Away they skurried. I lost sight of them
when they were once off the poop, and it
seemed an eternity before they showed
themselves again on the forecastle.</p>

<p>No wonder! They had to wade and
struggle through a rough sea on the main-deck,
which obliged them to hold on, for
minutes at a time, to whatever they could
put their hands to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
I wanted them to bear a hand in getting
rid of the staysail, for, with the wheel hard
down, the ship showed a tendency to fall
off. But it was impossible for me to make
my voice heard; I could only wave my
hand; the boatswain understood the gesture,
and I saw him motion to Cornish to clear
off the forecastle. He then ran over to
leeward and let go the fore-topmast staysail
sheet and halliards, and, this done, he could
do no more but take to his heels.</p>

<p>The hullabaloo was frightful&mdash;the thundering
of the sails, the snapping and cracking
of the sheets.</p>

<p>Boom! I knew it must follow. It was
a choice of two evils&mdash;to poop the ship or
lose a mast.</p>

<p>Down came the topmast, splintering and
crashing with a sound that rose above the
roar of the gale, and in a minute was swinging
against the shrouds&mdash;an awful wreck to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
behold in such a scene of raging sea and
buried decks.</p>

<p>I knew well now what ought to be done,
and done without delay; for the staysail
was in the water, ballooning out to every
wave, and dragging the ship's head round
more effectually than had the sail been set.</p>

<p>But I had a wonderful ally in the boatswain&mdash;keen,
unerring, and intrepid, a consummate
sailor. I should never have had
the heart to give him the order; and yet
there he was, and Cornish by his side, at
work, knife in hand, cutting and hacking
away for dear life.</p>

<p>A long and perilous job indeed!&mdash;now up
aloft, now down, soaked by the incessant
seas that thundered over the ship's bows,
tripping over the raffle that encumbered the
deck, actually swarming out on the bowsprit
with their knives between their teeth,
at moments plunged deep in the sea, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
busy again as they were lifted high in the
air.</p>

<p>I draw my breath as I write. I have the
scene before me: I see the ropes parting
under the knives of the men. I close my
eyes as I behold once more the boiling
wave that buries them, and dare not look,
lest I should find them gone. I hear
the hooting of the hurricane, the groaning
of the over-loaded vessel, and over all the
faint hurrah those brave spirits utter as the
last rope is severed and the unwieldly wreck
of spars and cordage falls overboard and
glides away upon a running sea, and the
ship comes to again under my hand, and
braves, with her bows almost at them, the
merciless onslaught of the huge green
waves.</p>

<p>Only the day before, one of these men
was a mutineer, blood-stained already, and
prepared for new murders!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Strange translation! from base villainy
to actions heroical! But those who know
sailors best will least doubt their capacity
of gauging extremes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p>By the loss of the fore-topmast the ship was
greatly eased. In almost every sea that
we had encountered since leaving England,
I had observed the immense leverage exerted
over the deep-lying hull by the weight of
her lofty spars; and by the effect which the
carrying away of the fore-topmast had produced,
I had no doubt that our position
would be rendered far less critical, while
the vessel would rise to the waves with
much greater ease, if we could rid her of a
portion of her immense top-weight.</p>

<p>I waited until the boatswain came aft,
and then surrendered the wheel to Cornish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
after which I crouched with the boatswain
under the lee of the companion, where, at
least, we could hear each other's voices.</p>

<p>"She pitches easier since that fore-topmast
went, bo'sun. There is still too much
top-hamper. The main-royal stay is gone,
and the mast can't stand long, I think,
unless we stay it forrard again. But we
mustn't lose the topmast."</p>

<p>"No, we can't do without him. Yet
there's a risk of him goin' too, if you cut
away the top-gall'nt backstays. What's to
prevent him?" said he, looking up at the
mast.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how to prevent it," I
replied. "I'll go aloft with a hand-saw and
wound the mast. What do you think?
Shall we let it carry away?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied promptly. "She'll be
another ship with them masts out of her.
If it comes on fine we'll make shift to bend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
on the new foresail, and get a jib on her by
a stay from the lower mast-head to the bowsprit
end. Then," he continued, calculating
on his fingers, "we shall have the main-topmast
stays'l, mizzen-topmast stays'l,
main-topsail, mains'l, mizzen, mizzen-tops'l,&mdash;six
and two makes height&mdash;height sails
on her&mdash;a bloomin' show o' canvas!"</p>

<p>He ran his eye aloft, and said <span class="locked">emphatically&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I'm for lettin' of 'em go, most sartinly."</p>

<p>I got up, but he caught hold of my arm.</p>

<p>"I'll go aloft," said he.</p>

<p>"No, no," I replied, "it's my turn. You
stand by to cut away the lanyards to leeward,
and then get to windward and wait
for me. We must watch for a heavy lurch,
for we don't want the spars to fall amidships
and drive a hole through the deck."</p>

<p>Saying which I got off the poop and
made for the cabin lately shared between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the carpenter and the boatswain, where I
should find a saw in the tool chest.</p>

<p>I crept along the main-deck to leeward,
but was washed off my feet in spite of every
precaution, and thrown with my head
against the bulwark, but the blow was
more bewildering than hurtful. Fortunately,
everything was secure, so there
were no pounding casks and huge spars
driving about like battering rams, to dodge.</p>

<p>I found a saw, and also laid hold of the
sounding-rod, so that I might try the well,
being always very distrustful of the boatswain's
plugs in the fore hold; but on
drawing up the rod out of the sounding-pipe,
I found there were not above five to
six inches of water in her, and, as the
pumps sucked at four inches, I had not
only the satisfaction of knowing that the
ship was tight in her hull, but that she was
draining in very little water from her decks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
This discovery of the ship's soundness
filled me with joy, and, thrusting the saw
down my waistcoat, I sprang into the
main-rigging with a new feeling of life in
me.</p>

<p>I could not help thinking as I went
ploughing and clinging my way up the
ratlines, that the hurricane was less furious
than it had been an hour ago; but this, I
dare say, was more my hope than my conviction,
for, exposed as I now was to the
full force of the wind, its power and outcry
were frightful. There were moments when
it jammed me so hard against the shrouds
that I could not have stirred an inch&mdash;no,
not to save my life.</p>

<p>I remember once reading an account of
the wreck of a vessel called the <i>Wager</i>,
where it was told that so terrible was the
appearance of the sea that many of the
sailors went raving mad with fear at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
sight of it, some throwing themselves overboard
in their delirium, and others falling
flat on the deck and rolling to and fro with
the motion of the ship, without making the
smallest effort to help themselves.</p>

<p>I believe that much such a sea as drove
those poor creatures wild was spread below
me now, and I can only thank Almighty God
for giving me the courage to witness the
terrible spectacle without losing my reason.</p>

<p>No words that I am master of could submit
the true picture of this whirling, mountainous,
boiling scene to you. The waves,
fore-shortened to my sight by my elevation
above them, drew nevertheless a deeper
shadow into their caverns, so that, so lively
was this deception of colouring, each time
the vessel's head fell into one of these
hollows, it seemed as though she were
plunging into a measureless abysm, as roaring
and awful as a maelström, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
it would be impossible for her to rise in
time to lift to the next great wave that was
rushing upon her.</p>

<p>When, after incredible toil, I succeeded
in gaining the cross-trees, I paused for
some moments to recover breath, during
which I looked, with my fingers shading my
eyes, carefully all round the horizon, but
saw no ship in sight.</p>

<p>The topmast was pretty steady, but the
top-gallant mast rocked heavily, owing to
the main-royal stay being carried away;
moreover, the boatswain had already let go
the royal and top-gallant braces, so that
they might run out when the mast fell, and
leave it free to go overboard; and the yards
swinging in the wind and to the plunging of
the ship, threatened every moment to bring
down the whole structure of masts, including
all or a part of the topmast, so that I was
in the greatest peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
In order, therefore, to lose no time, I put
my knife in my teeth, and shinned up the
top-gallant rigging, where, holding on with
one hand, I cut the top-gallant stay adrift,
though the strands were so hard that I
thought I should never accomplish the job.
This support being gone, the mast jumped
wildly, insomuch that I commended my
soul to God, every instant believing that I
should be shaken off the mast or that it
would go overboard with me.</p>

<p>However, I succeeded in sliding down
again into the cross-trees, and having cut
away the top-gallant rigging to leeward, I
pulled out my saw and went to work at the
mast with it, sawing the mast just under
the yard, so that it might go clean off at
that place.</p>

<p>When I had sawed deep enough, I cut
away the weather rigging and got down
into the maintop as fast as ever I could, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
sung out to the boatswain to cut away to
leeward.</p>

<p>By the time I reached the deck, all was
adrift to leeward, and the mast was now
held in its place by the weather backstays.
I dropped into the chains and there helped
the boatswain with my knife, and, watching
an opportunity when the ship rolled heavily
to leeward, we cut through the lanyards of
the top-gallant backstay, and the whole
structure of spar, yards, and rigging went
flying overboard.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the success of these
operations, and well knowing that a large
measure of our safety depended upon our
easing the ship of her top-hamper, I sung
out that we would now cut away the
mizzen top-gallant mast, and once more
went aloft, though the boatswain begged
hard to take my place this time.</p>

<p>This spar, being much lighter and smaller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
did not threaten me so dangerously as the
other had done, and in a tolerably short
space of time we had sent it flying overboard
after the main top-gallant mast; and
all this we did without further injury to
ourselves than a temporary deprivation of
strength and breath.</p>

<p>The ship had now the appearance of a
wreck; and yet in her mutilated condition
was safer than she had been at any moment
since the gale first sprang up. The easing
her of all this top-weight seemed to make
her as buoyant as though we had got a hundred
tons of cargo out of her. Indeed,
I was now satisfied, providing everything
stood, and the wind did not increase in
violence, that she would be able to ride out
the gale.</p>

<p>Cornish (as well as the boatswain and
myself) was soaked through and through;
we therefore arranged that the boatswain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
and I should go below and shift our clothes,
and that the boatswain should then relieve
Cornish.</p>

<p>So down we went, I, for one, terribly
exhausted, but cheered all the same by an
honest hope that we should save our lives
and the ship after all.</p>

<p>I stepped into the pantry to swallow a
dram so as to get my nerves together, for I
was trembling all over with the weariness
in me, and cold as ice on the skin from the
repeated dousings I had received; and then
changed my clothes; and never was anything
more comforting and grateful than
the feel of the dry flannel and the warm
stockings and sea-boots which I exchanged
for shoes that sopped like brown paper and
came to pieces in my hand when I pulled
them off.</p>

<p>The morning was far advanced, a little
past eleven. I was anxious to ask Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Robertson how she did, and reassure her as
to our position before going on deck to take
observations, and therefore went to her
cabin door and listened, meaning to knock
and ask her leave to see her if I heard her
voice in conversation with her father.</p>

<p>I strained my ear, but the creaking and
groaning of the ship inside, and the bellowing
of the wind outside, were so violent,
that had the girl been singing at the top of
her voice I do not believe that I should
have heard her.</p>

<p>I longed to see her, and shook the handle
of the door, judging that she would distinguish
this sound amid the other noises
which prevailed, and, sure enough, the door
opened, and her sweet face looked out.</p>

<p>She showed herself fully when she saw
me, and came into the cuddy, and was
going to address me, but a look of agonized
sorrow came into her face; she dropped on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
her knees before the bench at the table
and buried her head, and never was there
an attitude of grief more expressive of
piteous misery than this.</p>

<p>My belief was that the frightful rolling of
the ship had crazed her brain, and that she
fancied I had come to tell her we were
sinking.</p>

<p>Not to allow this false impression to
affect her an instant longer than could be
helped, I dropped on one knee by her side,
and at once told her that the ship had been
eased, and was riding well, and that the
gale, as I believed, was breaking.</p>

<p>She shook her head, still keeping her face
buried, as though she would say that it was
not the danger we were in that had given
her that misery.</p>

<p>"Tell me what has happened?" I exclaimed.
"Your troubles and trials have
been very, very great&mdash;too great for you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
bear, brave and true-hearted as you are. It
unmans me and breaks me down to see you
in this attitude. For your own sake, keep
up your courage a little longer. The first
ship that passes when this gale abates will
take us on board; and there are three of us
still with you who will never yield an inch
to any danger that may come whilst their
life holds out and yours remains to be
saved."</p>

<p>She upturned her pale face, streaming
with tears, and said the simple words, but in
a tone I shall never forget&mdash;"Papa is dead!"</p>

<p>Was it so, indeed?</p>

<p>And was I so purblind as to wrong her
beautiful and heroic character by supposing
her capable of being crazed with fears for
her own life.</p>

<p>I rose from her side, and stood looking
at her in silence. I had nothing to say.</p>

<p>However dangerous our situation might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
have been, I should still have known how
to comfort and encourage her.</p>

<p>But&mdash;her father was dead!</p>

<p>This was a blow I could not avert&mdash;a
sorrow no labour could remit. It struck
home hard to me.</p>

<p>I took her hand and raised her, and
entered the cabin hand in hand with her.
The moisture of the deck dulled the transparency
of the bull's-eye, but sufficient
light was admitted through the port-hole
to enable me to see him. He was as white
as a sheet, and his hair frosted his head,
and made him resemble a piece of marble
carving. His under jaw had dropped, and
that was the great and prominent signal of
the thing that had come to him.</p>

<p>Poor old man! lying dead under the
coarse blanket, with his thin hands folded,
as though he had died in prayer, and a
most peaceful holy calm in his face!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Was it worth while bringing him from
the wreck for this?</p>

<p>"God was with him when he died," I
said, and I closed his poor eyes as tenderly
as my rough hands would let me.</p>

<p>She looked at him, speechless with grief,
and then burst into an uncontrollable fit of
crying.</p>

<p>My love and tenderness, my deep pity
of her lonely helplessness, were all so great
an impulse in me that I took her in my
arms and held her whilst she sobbed upon
my shoulder. I am sure that she knew my
sorrow was deep and real, and that I held
her to my heart that she might not feel her
loneliness.</p>

<p>When her great outburst of grief was
passed, I made her sit; and then she told
me that when she had left the deck, she
had looked at her father before lying down,
and thought him sleeping very calmly. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
was not dead then. Oh, no! she had
noticed by the motion of the covering on
him that he was breathing peacefully.
Being very tired she had fallen asleep
quickly, and slept soundly. She awoke, not
half an hour before she heard me trying the
handle of the door. The rolling and straining
of the ship frightened her, and she
heard one of the masts go overboard. She
got out of bed, meaning to call her father,
so that he might be ready to follow her, if
the ship were sinking (as she believed it
was), on to the deck, but could not wake
him. She took him by the arm, and this
bringing her close to his face, she saw that
he was dead. She would have called me,
but dreaded to leave the cabin lest she
should be separated from her father. Meanwhile
she heard the fall of another mast
alongside, and the ship at the moment
rolling heavily, she believed the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
actually sinking, and flung herself upon her
father's body, praying to God that her death
might be mercifully speedy, and that the
waves might not separate them in death.</p>

<p>At this point she broke down and cried
again bitterly.</p>

<p>When I came to think over what she
had gone through during that half hour&mdash;the
dead body of her father before her, of
him whose life a few hours before she had
no serious fear of, and the bitterness of
death which she had tasted in the dreadful
persuasion that the vessel was sinking, I
was too much affected to speak. I could
only hold her hands and caress them, wondering
in my heart that God who loves and
blesses all things that are good and pure,
should single out this beautiful, helpless,
heroic girl for suffering so complicated and
miserable.</p>

<p>After a while I explained that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
necessary I should leave her, as I was
desirous of observing the position of the
sun, and promised, if no new trouble detained
me on deck, to return to her as soon
as I had completed my observations.</p>

<p>So without further words I came away
and got my sextant, and went on deck.</p>

<p>I found Cornish still at the wheel, and
the boatswain leaning over the weather side
of the ship about half-way down the poop,
watching the hull of the vessel as she rolled
and plunged. I might have saved myself
the trouble of bringing the sextant with me,
for there was not only no sign of the sun
now, but no promise of its showing itself
even for a minute. Three impenetrable
strata of cloud obscured the heavens: the
first, a universal mist or thickness, tolerably
bright as it lay nearest the sun; beneath
this, ranges of heavier clouds, which had
the appearance of being stationary, owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to the speed at which the ponderous smoke-coloured
clouds composing the lowest stratum
were swept past them. Under this
whirling gloomy sky the sea was tossing in
mountains, and between sea and cloud the
storm was sweeping with a stupendous
voice, and with a power so great that no
man on shore who could have experienced
its fury there, would believe that anything
afloat could encounter it and live.</p>

<p>I remained until noon anxiously watching
the sky, hoping that the outline of the sun
might swim out, if for a few moments only,
and give me a chance to fix it.</p>

<p>I was particularly wishful to get sights,
because, if the wind abated, we might be
able to wear the ship and stand for the Bermudas,
which was the land the nearest to
us that I knew of. But I could not be
certain as to the course to be steered unless
I knew my latitude and longitude. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
<i>Grosvenor</i>, now hove to in this furious
gale, was drifting dead to leeward at from
three to four knots an hour. Consequently,
if the weather remained thick and
this monstrous sea lasted, I should be out
of my reckoning altogether next day.
This was the more to be deplored, as every
mile was of serious consequence to persons
in our position, as it would represent so
many hours more of hard work and bitter
expectation.</p>

<p>The boatswain had by this time taken the
wheel, to let Cornish go below to change his
clothes, and, as no conversation could be
carried on in that unsheltered part of the
deck, I reserved what I had to say to him
for another opportunity, and returned to
the cuddy.</p>

<p>I could not bear to think of the poor girl
being alone with her dead father in the
darksome cabin, where the grief of death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
would be augmented by the dismaying
sounds of the groaning timbers and the
furious wash of the water against the ship's
side.</p>

<p>I went to her and begged her to come
to me to my own cabin, which, being to
windward and having two bull's-eyes in
the deck, was lighter and more cheerful
than hers.</p>

<p>"Your staying here," I said, "cannot
recall your poor father to life, and I know,
if he were alive, he would wish me to take
you away. He will rest quietly here, Miss
Robertson, and we will close the cabin door
and leave him for a while."</p>

<p>I drew her gently from the cabin, and
when I had got her into the cuddy, I closed
the door upon the dead old man, and led
her by the hand to my own cabin.</p>

<p>"I intend," I said, "that you shall
occupy this berth, and I will remove into
the cabin next to this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
She answered in broken tones that she
could not bear the thought of being separated
from her father.</p>

<p>"But you will not be separated from
him," I answered, "even though you
should never see him more with your eyes.
There is only one separation, and that is
when the heart turns and the memory forgets.
He will always be with you in your
thoughts, a dear friend, a dear companion,
and father, as in life; not absent because
he is dead, since I think that death makes
those whom we love doubly our own, for they
become spirits to watch over us, to dwell
near us, let us journey where we please, and
their affection is not to be chilled by any
worldly selfishness. Try to think thus of
the dead. It is not a parting that should
pain us. Your father has set out on his
journey before you; death is but a short
leave-taking, and only a man who is doomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to live for ever could look upon death as an
eternal separation."</p>

<p>She wept quietly, and once or twice
looked at me as though she would smile
through her tears, to let me know that she
was grateful for my poor attempts to console
her; but she could not smile. Rough
and idle as my words were, yet, in the fulness
of my sympathy, and my knowledge of
her trials, and my sense of the dangers
which, even as I spoke, were raging round
us, my voice faltered, and I turned to hide
my face.</p>

<p>It happened then that my eye lighted
upon the little Bible I had carried with me
in all my voyages ever since I had gone to
sea, and I felt that now, with the old man
lying dead, and his poor child's grief, and
our own hard and miserable position, was
the fitting time to invoke God's mercy, and
to pray to Him to watch over us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
I spoke to that effect to Miss Robertson,
and said that if she consented I would call
in Cornish and the steward and ask them
to join us; that the boatswain was at the
wheel and could not leave his post, but we
might believe that the Almighty would
accept the brave man's faithful discharge
of his duty as a prayer, and would not
overlook him, if our prayers were accepted,
because he could not kneel in company
with us.</p>

<p>"Let him know that we are praying,"
she exclaimed, eagerly, "and he will pray
too."</p>

<p>I saw that my suggestion had aroused
her, and at once left the cabin and went on
deck, and going close to the boatswain I
<span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Robertson is dead, and his
daughter is in great grief."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor lady!" he replied. "I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
God 'll spare her. She's a brave young
woman, and seen a sight more trouble
within the last fortnight than so pretty a
gell desarves."</p>

<p>"Bo'sun, I am going to call in Cornish
and the steward, and read prayers and ask
God for His protection. I should have
liked you, brave old messmate, to join; but,
as you can't leave the deck, pray with us
in your heart, will you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, that I will, heartily; an' I hope
for the lady's sake that God Almighty 'll
hear us, for I'd sooner die myself than she
should, poor gell, for I'm older, and it's my
turn afore hers by rights."</p>

<p>I clapped him on the back and went
below, where I called to the steward and
Cornish, both of whom came aft on hearing
my voice.</p>

<p>During my absence, Miss Robertson had
taken the Bible and laid it open on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
table; and when the two men came in I
<span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My lads, we are in the hands of God,
who is our Father; and I will ask you to
join this lady and me in thanking Him for
the mercy and protection He has already
vouchsafed us, and to pray to Him to lead
us out of present peril and bring us safely
to the home we love."</p>

<p>The steward said "Yes, sir," and looked
about him for a place to sit or kneel, but
Cornish hung his head and glanced at the
door shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"You need not stop unless you wish,
Cornish," said I. "But why should you
not join us? The way you have worked,
the honest manner in which you have
behaved, amply atone for the past. From
no man can more than hearty repentance
be expected, and we all stand in need of
each other's prayers. Join us, mate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
"Won't it be makin' a kind of game o'
religion for the likes o' me to pray?" he
answered. "I was for murderin' you an'
the lady and all hands as are left on board
this wessel&mdash;what 'ud be the use o' <i>my</i>
prayers?"</p>

<p>Miss Robertson went over to him and
took his hand.</p>

<p>"God," said she, "has told us that there
is more joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth than over ninety and nine just
persons who need no repentance. But
who is good among us, Cornish? Be sure
that as you repent so are you forgiven. My
poor father lies dead in his cabin, and I
wish you to pray with me for him, and to
pray with us for our own poor lives. Mr.
Royle," she said, "Cornish will stay."</p>

<p>And with an expression on her face of
infinite sweetness and pathos, she drew him
to one of the cushioned lockers and seated
herself by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
I saw that her charming wonderful grace,
her cordial tender voice, and her condescension,
which a man of his condition
would feel, had deeply moved him.</p>

<p>The steward seated himself on the other
side of her, and I began to read from the
open book before me, beginning the chapter
which she had chosen for us during my
absence on deck. This chapter was the
eleventh of St. John, wherein is related
the story of that sickness "which was
not unto death, but for the glory of God,
that the Son of God might be glorified
thereby."</p>

<p>I read only to the thirty-sixth verse, for
what followed that did not closely apply to
our position; but there were passages preceding
it which stirred me to the centre of
my heart, knowing how they went home to
the mourner, more especially those pregnant
lines&mdash;"Martha saith unto Him, I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that he shall rise again in the resurrection
at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am
the resurrection and the life: he that believeth
in Me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live," which made me feel that the
words I had formerly addressed to her were
not wholly idle.</p>

<p>I then turned to St. Matthew, and read
from the eighth chapter those few verses
wherein it is told that Christ entered a ship
with His disciples, and that there arose a
great storm. Only men in a tempest at
sea, their lives in jeopardy, and worn out
with anxiety and the fear of death, know
how great is the comfort to be got out of
this brief story of our Lord's power over the
elements, and His love of those whom He
died to save; and, taking this as a kind of
text, I knelt down, the others imitating me,
and prayed that He who rebuked the sea
and the wind before His doubting disciples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
would be with us who believed in Him in
our present danger.</p>

<p>Many things I said (feeling that He whom
I addressed was our Father, and that He
alone could save us) which have gone from
my mind, and tears stood in my eyes as I
prayed; but I was not ashamed to let the
others see them, even if they had not been
as greatly affected as I, which was not the
case. Nor would I conclude my prayer
without entreating God to comfort the heart
of the mourner, and to receive in heaven
the soul of him for whom she was weeping.</p>

<p>I then shook Cornish and the steward
heartily by the hand, and I am sure, by the
expression in Cornish's face, that he was
glad he had stayed, and that his kneeling
in prayer had done him good.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "you had best get your
dinner, and relieve the boatswain; and you,
steward, obtain what food you can, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
bring it to us here, and then you and the
bo'sun can dine together."</p>

<p>The two men left the cabin, and I went
and seated myself beside Miss Robertson,
and said all that I could to comfort her.</p>

<p>She was very grateful to me for my
prayers for herself and her father, and
already, as though she had drawn support
from our little service, spoke with some
degree of calmness of his death. It would
have made her happy, she said, could she
have kissed him before he died, and have
been awake to attend to any last want.</p>

<p>I told her that I believed he had died in
his sleep, without a struggle; for, so recent
as his death was, less placidity would have
appeared in his face had he died awake or
conscious. I added that secretly I had
never believed he would live to reach
Valparaiso, had the ship continued her
voyage. He was too old a man to suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
and survive the physical and mental trials
he had passed through; and sad though
his death was under the circumstances
which surrounded it, yet she must think
that it had only been hastened a little; for
he was already an old man, and his end
might have been near, even had all prospered
and he had reached England in his
own ship.</p>

<p>By degrees I drew her mind away from
the subject by leading her thoughts to our
own critical position. At another time I
should have softened my account of our
danger: but I thought it best to speak
plainly, as the sense of the insecurity of our
lives would in some measure distract her
thoughts from her father's death.</p>

<p>She asked me if the storm was not
abating.</p>

<p>"It is not increasing in violence," I
answered, "which is a good sign. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
there is one danger to be feared which must
very shortly take me on deck. The wind
may suddenly lull and blow again hard from
another quarter. This would be the worst
thing that could happen to us, for we
should then have what is called a cross sea,
and the ship is so deeply loaded that we
might have great difficulty in keeping her
afloat."</p>

<p>"May I go on deck with you?"</p>

<p>"You would not be able to stand. Feel
this!" I exclaimed, as the ship's stern rose
to a sickening height and then came down,
down, down, with the water roaring about
her as high as our ears.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied, meaning to keep
her under the companion, half-way up the
ladder.</p>

<p>I took a big top-coat belonging to the
captain and buttoned her up in it, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
tied his fur cap over her head, so that she
would be well protected from the wind,
whilst the coat would keep her dress close
against her.</p>

<p>I then slipped on my oilskins, and taking
a strong grip of her hand to steady her, led
her up the companion ladder.</p>

<p>"Do not come any farther," said I.</p>

<p>"Wherever you go I will go," she
answered, grasping my arm.</p>

<p>Admiring her courage and stirred by her
words, which were as dear to me as a kiss
from her lips would have been, I led her
right on to the deck over to windward, and
made her sit on a small coil of rope just
under the rail.</p>

<p>The sea was no heavier than it had been
since the early morning, and yet my short
absence below had transformed it into a
sublime and stupendous novelty.</p>

<p>You will remember that not only was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<i>Grosvenor</i> a small ship, but that she lay
deep, with a free board lower by a foot and
a half than she ought to have shown.</p>

<p>The height from the poop rail to the
water was not above twelve feet; and it is
therefore no exaggeration to say that the
sea, running from fifteen to twenty feet
high, stood like walls on either side of
her.</p>

<p>To appreciate the effect of such a sea
upon a ship like the <i>Grosvenor</i>, you must
have crossed the Atlantic in a hurricane,
not in an immense and powerful ocean
steamer, but in a yacht.</p>

<p>But even this experience would not
enable you to realise our danger; for the
yacht would not be overloaded with cargo,
she would probably be strong, supple, and
light; whereas the <i>Grosvenor</i> was choked
to the height of the hold with seven
hundred and fifty tons of dead weight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
was a Nova Scotia soft wood ship, which
means that she might start a butt at any
moment and go to pieces in one of her
frightful swoops downwards.</p>

<p>Having lodged Miss Robertson in a
secure and sheltered place, I crawled along
the poop on to the main-deck and sounded
the well again. I found a trifle over six
inches of water in her, which satisfied me
that she was still perfectly tight, and that
the extra leakage was owing to the drainings
from the decks.</p>

<p>I regained the poop and communicated
the good news to the boatswain, who
nodded; but I noticed that there was
more anxiety in his face than I liked to
see, and that he watched the ship very
closely each time she pitched with extra
heaviness.</p>

<p>Miss Robertson was looking up at the
masts with alarmed eyes; but I pointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
them and smiled, and shook my head to let
her know that their wrecked appearance
need not frighten her. I then took the
telescope, and, making it fast over my
back, clambered into the mizzen-top, she
watching my ascent with her hands tightly
clasped.</p>

<p>The ensign still roared some half-dozen
feet below the gaff-end; it was a brave bit
of bunting to hold on as it did. I planted
myself firmly against the rigging, and carefully
swept the weather horizon, and finding
nothing there, pointed the glass to
leeward; but all that part of the sea was
likewise a waste of foaming waves, with
never a sign of a ship in all the raging
seas.</p>

<p>I was greatly disappointed, for though
no ship could have helped us in such a sea,
yet the sight of one hove to near us&mdash;and
no ship afloat, sailer or steamer, but must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
have hove to in that gale&mdash;would have
comforted us greatly, as a promise of help
at hand, and rescue to come when the wind
should have gone down.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>All that day the wind continued to blow
with frightful force, and the sky to wear
its menacing aspect. On looking, however,
at the barometer at four o'clock in the
afternoon, I observed a distinct rise in the
mercury; but I did not dare to feel elated
by this promise of an improvement; for, as
I have before said, the only thing the
mercury foretells is a change of weather,
but what kind of change you shall never be
sure of until it comes.</p>

<p>What I most dreaded was the veering of
the gale to an opposite quarter, whereby, a
new sea being set running right athwart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
or in the eye of the already raging sea, our
decks would be helplessly swept and the
ship grow unmanageable.</p>

<p>A little after eight the wind sensibly
decreased, and, to my great delight, the
sky cleared in the direction whence the
gale was blowing, so that there was a prospect
of the sea subsiding before the wind
shifted, that is, if it shifted at all.</p>

<p>When Cornish, who had been below
resting after a long spell, came on deck and
saw the stars shining, and that the gale was
moderating, he stared upwards like one
spell-bound, and then, running up to me,
seized my hand and wrung it in silence.</p>

<p>I heartily returned this mute congratulation,
and we both went over and shook
hands with the boatswain; and those who
can appreciate the dangers of the frightful
storm that had been roaring about us all
day, and feel with us in the sentiments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
despair and helplessness which the peril we
stood in awoke in us, will understand the
significance of our passionate silence as we
held each other's hand and looked upon the
bright stars, which shone like the blessing
of God upon our forlorn state.</p>

<p>I was eager to show Mary Robertson
those glorious harbingers, and ran below to
bring her on deck.</p>

<p>I found her again in the cabin in which
her father lay, bending over his body in
prayer. I waited until she turned her head,
and then exclaimed that the wind was
falling, and that all the sky in the north-west
was bright with stars, and begged her
to follow me and see them.</p>

<p>She came immediately, and, after looking
around her, cried out in a rapturous <span class="locked">voice&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Royle! God has heard our
prayers!" and, in the wildness of her
emotions, burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
I held her hand as I <span class="locked">answered&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It was your grief that moved me to
pray to Him, and I consider you our guardian
angel on board this ship, and that God who
loves you will spare our lives for your
sake."</p>

<p>"No, no; do not say so; I am not
worthier than you&mdash;not worthier than the
brave boatswain and Cornish, whose repentance
would do honour to the noblest heart.
Oh, if my poor father had but been spared
to me!"</p>

<p>She turned her pale face and soft and
swimming eyes up to the stars and gazed at
them intently, as though she witnessed a
vision there.</p>

<p>But though the wind had abated, it still
blew a gale, and the sea boiled and tumbled
about us and over our decks in a manner
that would have been terrifying had we not
seen it in a greater state of fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
I sent the steward forward to see if he
could get the galley fire to burn, so as to
boil us some water for coffee, for though the
ship was in a warm latitude, yet the wind,
owing to its strength, was at times piercingly
cold, and we all longed for a hot drink&mdash;a
cup of hot coffee or cocoa being infinitely
more invigorating, grateful, and warming
than any kind of spirits drunk cold.</p>

<p>All that the steward did, however, was to
get wet through; and this he managed so
effectually that he came crawling aft, looking
precisely as if he had been fished out of
the water with grappling-hooks.</p>

<p>I lighted a bull's-eye lamp and went to
the pumps and sounded the well.</p>

<p>On hauling up the rod I found to my
consternation that there were nine inches
of water in the ship.</p>

<p>I was so much startled by this discovery
that I stood for some moments motionless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
then, bethinking me that one of the plugged
auger holes might be leaking, I slipped
forward without saying a word to the others,
and, getting a large mallet from the tool-chest,
I entered the forecastle, so as to get
into the fore peak.</p>

<p>I had not been in the forecastle since the
men had left the ship, and I cannot describe
the effect produced upon me by this dark
deserted abode, with its row of idly swinging
hammocks glimmering in the light shed by
the bull's-eye lamp; the black chests of the
seamen which they had left behind them;
here and there a suit of dark oilskins suspended
by a nail and looking like a hanged
man; the hollow space resonant with the
booming thunder of the seas and the mighty
wash of water swirling over the top-gallant
deck.</p>

<p>The whole scene took a peculiarly ghastly
significance from the knowledge that of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the men who had occupied those hammocks
and bunks, one only survived; for four of
them we ourselves had killed, and I could
not suppose that the long-boat had lived
ten minutes after the gale had broken upon
her.</p>

<p>I made my way over the cable-ranges,
stooping my head to clear the hammocks,
and striking my shins against the sea-chests,
and swung myself into the hold.</p>

<p>Here I found myself against the water
casks, close against the cargo, and just beyond
was the bulk-head behind which the
boatswain had hidden while Stevens bored
the holes.</p>

<p>Carefully throwing the light over the
walls, I presently perceived the plugs or
ends of the broom-stick protruding; and
going close to them I found they were
perfectly tight, that no sign of moisture was
visible around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
It may seem strange that this discovery
vexed and alarmed me.</p>

<p>And yet this was the case.</p>

<p>It would have made me perfectly easy in
my mind to have seen the water gushing in
through one of these holes, because not
only would a few blows of the mallet have
set it to rights, but it would have acquainted
me with the cause of the small increase of
water in the hold.</p>

<p>Now that cause must be sought elsewhere.</p>

<p>Was it possible that the apprehensions I
had felt each time the ship had taken one
of her tremendous headers were to be
realised?&mdash;that she had strained a butt or
started a bolt in some ungetatable place?</p>

<p>Here where I stood, deep in the ship,
below the water-line, it was frightful to
hear her straining, it was frightful to feel
her motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
The whole place resounded with groans
and cries, as if the hold had been filled with
wounded men.</p>

<p>What bolts, though forged by a Cyclops,
could resist that horrible grinding?&mdash;could
hold together the immense weight which
the sea threw up as a child a ball, leaving
parts of it poised in air, out of water, unsustained
save by the structure that contained
it, then letting the whole hull fall
with a hollow, horrible crash into a chasm
between the waves, beating it first here,
then there, with blows the force of which
was to be calculated in hundreds of tons?</p>

<p>I scrambled up through the fore scuttle,
and perceiving Cornish smoking a pipe
under the break of the poop, I desired he
would go and relieve the boatswain at the
wheel for a short while and send him to me,
as I had something particular to say to him.</p>

<p>I waited until the boatswain came, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
here was the best place I could choose to
conduct a conversation.</p>

<p>Beyond all question the wind was falling,
and though the ship still rolled terribly, she
was not taking in nearly so much water
over her sides.</p>

<p>I re-trimmed the lamp in my hand, and
in a few minutes the boatswain joined me.</p>

<p>I said to him at <span class="locked">once&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I have just made nine inches of water
in the hold."</p>

<p>"When was that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"When you sounded the well before
what did you find?"</p>

<p>"Between five and six inches."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, sir," said he.
"You'll hexcuse me sayin' of it, but it's no
easy job to get at the true depth of water in
a ship's bottom when she's tumblin' about
like this here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
"I think I got correct soundings."</p>

<p>"Suppose," he continued, "you drop the
rod when she's on her beam ends. Where's
the water? Why, the water lies all on one
side, and the rod 'll come up pretty near
dry."</p>

<p>"I waited until the ship was level."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>you</i> did, because you knows your
work. But it's astonishin' what few persons
there are as really <i>does</i> know how to sound
the pumps. You'll hexcuse me, sir, but I
should like to drop the rod myself."</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied, "and I hope
you'll make it less than I."</p>

<p>In order to render my description clear to
readers not acquainted with such details, I
may state that in most large ships there is a
pipe that leads from the upper deck, alongside
the pumps, down to the bottom or
within a few inches of the bottom of the
vessel. The water in the hold necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
rises to the height of its own level in this
pipe; and in order to gauge the depth of
water, a dry rod of iron, usually graduated
in feet and inches, is attached to the end of
a line and dropped down the tube, and
when drawn up the depth of water is ascertained
by the height of the water on the rod.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that no method
for determining this essential point in a
ship's safety could well be more susceptible
of inaccuracy than this.</p>

<p>The immersed rod, on being withdrawn
from the tube, wets the sides of the tube;
hence, though the rod be dry when it is
dropped a second time, it is wetted in its
passage down the tube; and as the accuracy
of its indication is dependent on its
exhibiting the mark of the level of water, it
is manifest that if it becomes wetted before
reaching the water, the result it shows on
being withdrawn must be erroneous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Secondly, as the boatswain remarked to
me, if the well be sounded at any moment
when the vessel is inclined at any angle
on one side or the other, the water must
necessarily roll to the side to which the
vessel inclines, by which the height of the
water in the well is depressed, so that the
rod will not report the true depth.</p>

<p>Hence, to use the sounding-rod properly,
one must not only possess good sense, but
exercise very great judgment.</p>

<p>I held the lamp close to the sounding-pipe,
and the boatswain carefully dried the
rod on his coat preparatory to dropping it.</p>

<p>He then let it fall some distance down
the tube, keeping it, however, well above
the bottom, until the ship, midway in a
roll, stood for a moment on a level keel.</p>

<p>He instantly dropped the rod, and hauling
it up quickly, remarked that we had got the
true soundings this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
He held the rod to the light, and I found
it a fraction over nine inches.</p>

<p>"That's what it is, anyways," said he,
putting down the rod.</p>

<p>"An increase of three inches since the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothen to alarm us in
that, is there, Mr. Royle?" he exclaimed.
"Perhaps its one o' my plugs as wants
hammerin'."</p>

<p>"No, they're as tight as a new kettle," I
answered. "I have just come from examining
them."</p>

<p>"Well, all we've got to do is to pump
the ship out; and, if we can, make the
pumps suck all right. That 'll show us if
anything's wrong."</p>

<p>This was just the proposition I was about
to make; so I went into the cuddy and
sang out for the steward, but he was so
long answering that I lost my temper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
ran into the pantry, where I found him
shamming to be asleep.</p>

<p>I started him on to his legs and had him
on the main-deck in less time than he could
have asked what the matter was.</p>

<p>"Look here!" I cried, "if you don't turn
to and help us all to save our lives, I'll just
send you adrift in that quarter-boat with
the planks out of her bottom! What do
you mean by pretending to be asleep when
I sing out to you?"</p>

<p>And after abusing him for some time to
let him know that I would have no skulking,
and that if his life were worth having he
must save it himself, for we were not going
to do his work and our own as well, I bid
him lay hold of one of the pump-handles,
and we all three of us set to work to pump
the ship.</p>

<p>If this were not the heaviest job we had
yet performed, it was the most tiring; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
we plied our arms steadily and perseveringly,
taking every now and then a spell of rest,
and shifting our posts so as to vary our
postures; and after pumping I scarcely
know how long, the pumps sucked, whereat
the boatswain and I cheered heartily.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said the boatswain, as we
entered the cuddy to refresh ourselves with
a drain of brandy and water after our heavy
exertions, "we know that the ship's dry,
leastways, starting from the ship's bottom;
if the well's sounded agin at half-past ten&mdash;its
now half-past nine&mdash;that 'll be time
enough to find out if anything's gone
wrong."</p>

<p>"How about the watches? We're all
adrift again. Here's Cornish at the wheel,
and its your watch on deck."</p>

<p>As I said this, Miss Robertson came out
of the cabin where her father lay&mdash;do what
I might I could not induce her to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
away from the old man's body&mdash;and approaching
us slowly asked why we had been
pumping.</p>

<p>"Why, ma'm," replied the boatswain,
"it's always usual to pump the water out o'
wessels. On dry ships it's done sometimes
in the mornin' watch, and t'others they
pumps in the first dog watch. All accordin'.
Some wessels as they calls colliers require
pumpin' all day long; and the <i>Heagle</i>, which
was the fust wessel as I went to sea in,
warn't the only Geordie as required pumpin'
not only all day long but all night long as
well. Every wessel has her own custom,
but it's a werry dry ship indeed as don't
want pumpin' wunce a day."</p>

<p>"I was afraid," she said, "when I heard
the clanking of the pumps that water was
coming into the ship."</p>

<p>She looked at me earnestly, as though
she believed that this was the case and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
that I would not frighten her by telling her
so. I had learnt to interpret the language
of her eyes by this time, and answered her
doubts as though she had expressed them.</p>

<p>"I should tell you at once if there was
any danger threatened in that way," I said.
"There was more water in the ship than I
cared to find in her, and so the three of us
have been pumping her out."</p>

<p>"About them watches, Mr. Royle?" exclaimed
the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Well, begin afresh, if you like," I
replied. "I'll take the wheel for two
hours, and then you can relieve me."</p>

<p>"Why will you not let me take my turn
at the wheel?" said Miss Robertson.</p>

<p>The boatswain laughed.</p>

<p>"I have proved to you that I know how
to steer."</p>

<p>"Well, that's right enough," said the
boatswain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
"All three of you can lie down, then."</p>

<p>I smiled and shook my head.</p>

<p>Said the boatswain: "If your arms wur
as strong as your sperrit Miss, there'd be
no reason why you shouldn't go turn and
turn about with us."</p>

<p>"But I can hold the wheel."</p>

<p>"It 'ud fling you overboard. Listen to
its kickin'. You might as well try to prewent
one o' Barclay Perkins' dray hosses
from bustin' into a gallop by catchin' hold
o' it's tail. It 'ud be a poor look-out for
us to lose you, I can tell yer. What,"
continued the boatswain, energetically, "we
want to know is that you're sleepin', and
forgettin' all this here excitement in pleasing
dreams. To see a lady like you knocked
about by a gale o' wind is just one o' them
things I have no fancy for. Mr. Royle, if
I had a young and beautiful darter, and
a Dook or a Barryonet worth a thousand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
year, if that ain't sayin' too much, wos to
propose marriage to her, an' ax her to come
and be married to him in some fur-off place,
wich 'ud oblige her to cross the water, blowed
if I'd consent. No flesh an' blood o' mine
as I had any kind o' feeling for should set
foot on board ship without fust having a row
with me. Make no mistake. I'm talkin' o'
females, Miss. I say the sea ain't a fit place
for women and gells. It does middlin' well
for the likes of me and Mr. Royle here, as
aren't afraid o' carryin' full-rigged ships and
other agreeable dewices in gunpowder and
Hindian ink on our harms, and is seasoned,
as the sayin' is, to the wexations o' the
mariner's life. But when it comes to young
ladies crossin' the ocean, an' I don't care
wot they goes as&mdash;as passengers or skippers'
wives, or stewardishes, or female hemigrants&mdash;then
I say it ain't proper, and if
I'd ha' been a lawyer I'd ha' made it agin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the law, and contrived such a Act of
Paleyment as 'ud make the gent as took
his wife, darter, haunt, cousin, grandmother,
female nephey, or any relations in petticoats
to sea along with him, wish hisself hanged
afore he paid her passage money."</p>

<p>I was so much impressed by this vehement
piece of rhetoric, delivered with many
convulsions of the face, and a great deal of
hand-sawing, that I could not forbear mixing
him some more brandy and water, which
he drank at a draught, having first wished
Miss Robertson and myself long life and
plenty of happiness.</p>

<p>His declamation had quite silenced her,
though I saw by her eyes that she would
renew her entreaties the moment she had
me alone.</p>

<p>"Then you'll go on deck, sir, and relieve
Cornish, and I'll turn in?" observed the
boatswain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Right," said he, and was going.</p>

<p>I added:</p>

<p>"We must sound the well again at half-past
ten."</p>

<p>"Aye! aye!"</p>

<p>"I shan't be able to leave the wheel, and
I would rather you should sound than
Cornish. I'll send the steward to rouse
you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said he. And after waiting
to hear if I had anything more to say, he
entered his cabin, and in all probability
was sound asleep two minutes after.</p>

<p>Miss Robertson stood near the table, with
her hands folded and her eyes bent down.</p>

<p>I was about to ask her to withdraw to
her cabin and get some sleep.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, you are dreadfully tired and
worn out, and yet you are going on deck to
remain at the wheel for two hours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
"That is nothing."</p>

<p>"Why will you not let me take your
place?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the steward keep near that ladder
there, so that I can call to him if I want
you."</p>

<p>"Do you think I could rest with the
knowledge you were alone on deck?"</p>

<p>"You refuse because you believe I am
not to be trusted," she said gently, looking
down again.</p>

<p>"If your life were not dependent on the
ship's safety, I should not think of her
safety, but of yours. I refuse for your own
sake, not for mine&mdash;no, I will not say that.
For <i>both</i> our sakes I refuse. I have one
dear hope&mdash;well, I will call it a great ambition,
which I need not be ashamed to
own: it is, that I may be the means of
placing you on shore in England. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
hope has given me half the courage with
which I have fought on through danger
after danger since I first brought you from
the wreck. If anything should happen to
you now, I feel that all the courage and
strength of heart which have sustained me
would go. Is that saying too much? I do
not wish to exaggerate," I exclaimed, feeling
the blood in my cheeks, and lamenting,
without being able to control, the impulse
that had forced this speech from me, and
scarcely knowing whether to applaud or
detest myself for my candour.</p>

<p>She looked up at me with her frank,
beautiful eyes, but on a sudden averted
them from my face to the door of the
cabin where her dead father lay. A look
of indescribable anguish came over her, and
she drew a deep, long, sobbing breath.</p>

<p>Without another word, I took her hand
and led her to the cabin, and I knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
reason why she did not turn and speak
to me was that I might not see she was
weeping.</p>

<p>But it was a time for action, and I dared
not let the deep love that had come to
me for her divert my thoughts from my
present extremity.</p>

<p>I summoned the steward, who tumbled
out of his cabin smartly enough, and ordered
him to bring his mattress and lay it alongside
the companion ladder so as to be
within hail.</p>

<p>This done, I gained the poop and sent
Cornish below.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>As I stood at the wheel I considered how
I should act when the storm had passed.
And I was justified in so speculating, because
now the sky was clear right away
round, and the stars large and bright,
though a strong gale was still blowing and
keeping the sea very heavy.</p>

<p>Indeed, the clearness of the sky made
me think that the wind would go to the
eastward, but as yet there was no sign of
it veering from the old quarter.</p>

<p>We had been heading west ever since we
hove to, and travelling broadside on dead
south south-east. Now, if wind and sea
dropped, our business would be to make sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
if possible, and, with the wind holding
north north-west, make an eight hours'
board north-easterly, and then round and
stand for Bermuda.</p>

<p>This, of course, would depend upon the
weather.</p>

<p>It was, however, more than possible that
we should be picked up very soon by some
passing ship. It was not as though we
were down away in the South Pacific, or
knocking about in the poisonous Gulf of
Guinea, or up in the North Atlantic at 60°.
We were on a great ocean highway, crossed
and re-crossed by English, American, Dutch,
and French ships, to and from all parts of
the world; and bad indeed would our fortune
be, and baleful the star under which
we sailed, if we were not overhauled in a
short time and assistance rendered us.</p>

<p>A great though unexpressed ambition of
mine was to save the ship and navigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
her myself, not necessarily to England, but
to some port whence I could communicate
with her owners and ask for instructions.</p>

<p>As I have elsewhere admitted, I was entirely
dependent on my profession, my
father having been a retired army surgeon,
who had died extremely poor, leaving me
at the age of twelve an orphan, with no
other friend in the world than the vicar of
the parish we dwelt in, who generously sent
me to school for two years at his own
expense, and then, after sounding my inclinations,
apprenticed me to the sea.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, therefore, it
would be highly advantageous to my interests
to save the ship, since my doing
so would prefer some definite claims upon
the attention of the owners, or perhaps
excite the notice of another firm more
generous in their dealings with their servants,
and of a higher commercial standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Whilst I stood dreaming in this manner
at the wheel, allowing my thoughts to run
on until I pictured myself the commander
of a fine ship, and ending in allowing my
mind to become engrossed with thoughts of
Mary Robertson, whom I believed I should
never see again after we had bidden each
other farewell on shore, and who would
soon forget the young second mate, whom
destiny had thrown her with for a little
time of trouble and suffering and death,
I beheld a figure advance along the poop,
and on its approach I perceived the boatswain.</p>

<p>"I've been sounding the well, Mr.
Royle," said he. "I roused up on a sudden
and went and did it, as I woke up anxious;
and there's bad news, sir, twelve inches
o' water."</p>

<p>"Twelve inches!" I cried.</p>

<p>"It's true enough. I found the bull's-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>eye
on the cuddy table, and the rod don't
tell no lies when it's properly used."</p>

<p>"The pumps suck at four inches, don't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then that's a rise of eight inches since
half-past nine o'clock. What time is it
now?"</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes arter ten."</p>

<p>"We must man the pumps at once. Call
Cornish. You'll find the steward on a
mattress against the companion ladder."</p>

<p>He paused a moment to look round him
at the weather, and then went away.</p>

<p>I could not doubt now that the ship was
leaky, and after what we had endured, and
my fond expectation of saving the vessel&mdash;and
the miserable death, after all our hopes,
that might be in store for us&mdash;I felt that it
was very very hard on us, and I yielded to
a fit of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
What struck most home to me was that
my passionate dream to save Mary Robertson
might be defeated. The miseries which
had been accumulated on her wrung my
heart to think of. First her shipwreck, and
then the peril of the mutiny, and then
the dreadful storm that had held us face
to face with death throughout the fearful
day, and then the death of her father, and
now this new horror of the ship whereon
we stood filling with water beneath our
feet.</p>

<p>Yet hope&mdash;and God be praised for this
mercy to all men&mdash;springs eternal, and after
a few minutes my despair was mastered by
reflection. If the ship made no more water
than eight inches in three-quarters of an
hour, it would be possible to keep her afloat
for some days by regular spells at the pump,
and there were four hands to work them if
Miss Robertson steered whilst we pumped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
In that time it would be a thousand to one
if our signal of distress was not seen and
answered.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the men pumping on
the main-deck, and the boatswain's voice
singing to encourage the others. What
courage that man had! I, who tell this
story, am ashamed to think of the prominence
I give to my own small actions when
all the heroism belongs to him. I know not
what great writer it was who, visiting the
field of the battle of Waterloo, asked how
it was that the officers who fell in that fight
had graves and monuments erected to them,
when the soldiers&mdash;the privates by whom
all the hard work was done, who showed all
the courage and won the battle&mdash;lay nameless
in hidden pits? And so when we send
ships to discover the North Pole we have
little to say about poor Jack, who loses his
life by scurvy, or his toes and nose by frost-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>bites,
who labours manfully, and who makes
all the success of the expedition so far as
it goes. Our shouts are for Jack's officer;
we title him, we lionize him&mdash;<i>his</i> was all
the work, all the suffering, all the anxiety,
we think. I, who have been to sea, say
that Jack deserves as much praise as his
skipper, and perhaps a little more; and if
honour is to be bestowed, let Jack have his
share; and if a monument is to be raised,
let poor Jack's name be written on the
stone as well as the other's; for be sure
that Jack could have done without the
other, but also be sure that the other
couldn't have done without Jack.</p>

<p>Chained to my post, which I dared not
vacate for a moment, for the ship pitched
heavily, and required close watching as she
came to and fell off upon the swinging seas,
I grew miserably anxious to learn how the
pumping progressed, and felt that, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
boatswain, my own hands would do four
times the work of the other two.</p>

<p>It was our peculiar misfortune that of the
four men on board the ship three only should
be capable; and that as one of the three
men was constantly required at the wheel,
there were but two available men to do the
work. Had the steward been a sailor our
difficulties would have been considerably
diminished, and I bitterly deplored my want
of judgment in allowing Fish and the Dutchman
to be destroyed; for though I would
not have trusted Johnson and Stevens, yet
the other two might have been brought
over to work for us, and I had no doubt
that the spectacle of the perishing wretches
in the long-boat, as she was whirled past us,
would have produced as salutary an effect
upon them as it had upon Cornish; and
with two extra hands of this kind we could
not only have kept the pumps going, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
have made shift to sail the ship at the same
time.</p>

<p>The hollow thrashing sounds of the
pump either found Miss Robertson awake
or aroused her, for soon after the pumping
had commenced she came on deck,
swathed in the big warm overcoat and fur
cap.</p>

<p>Such a costume for a girl must make you
laugh in the description; and yet, believe
me, she lost in nothing by it. The coat
dwarfed her figure somewhat, but the fur
cap looked luxurious against her fair hair,
and nothing could detract from the exquisite
femininity of her face, manner, and carriage.
I speak of the impression she had made
on me in the daytime; the starlight only
revealed her white face now to me.</p>

<p>"Is the water still coming into the ship?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"The bo'sun has reported to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
eight inches deep have come into her since
half-past nine."</p>

<p>"Is that much?"</p>

<p>"More than we want."</p>

<p>"I don't like to trouble you with my
questions, Mr. Royle; but I am very,
very anxious."</p>

<p>"Of course you are; and do not suppose
that you can trouble. Ask me
what you will. I promise to tell you the
truth."</p>

<p>"If you find that you cannot pump the
water out as fast as it comes in, what will
you do?"</p>

<p>"Leave the ship."</p>

<p>"How?" she exclaimed, looking around
her.</p>

<p>"By that quarter-boat there."</p>

<p>"But it would fill with water and sink in
such waves as these."</p>

<p>"These waves are not going to last, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
it is quite likely that by this time to-morrow
the sea will be calm."</p>

<p>"Will the ship keep afloat until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"If the water does not come in more
rapidly than it does at present, the ship
will keep afloat so long as we can manage
to pump her out every hour. And so," said
I, laughing to encourage her, "we are not
going to die all at once, you see."</p>

<p>She drew quite close to me and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I shall never fear death while you
remain on board, Mr. Royle. You have
saved me from death once, and, though I
may be wicked in daring to prophesy, yet
I feel <i>certain</i>&mdash;<i>certain</i>," she repeated, with
singular emphasis, "that you will save my
life again."</p>

<p>"I shall try very hard, be sure of that,"
I answered.</p>

<p>"I believe&mdash;no, it is not so much a belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
as a strong conviction, with which my mind
seems to have nothing to do, that, whatever
dangers may be before us, you and I will
not perish."</p>

<p>She paused, and I saw that she was looking
at me earnestly.</p>

<p>"You will not think me superstitious if I
tell you that the reason of my conviction
is a dream? My poor father came and
stood beside me: he was so <i>real</i>! I
stretched out my arms to him, and he took
my hand and said, '<i>Darling, do not fear!
He who has saved your life once will save it
again. God will have mercy upon you and
him for the prayers you offered to Him.</i>' He
stooped and kissed me and faded away, and
I started up and heard the men pumping.
I went to look at him, for I thought ... I
thought he had really come to my side....
Oh, Mr. Royle, his spirit is with us!"</p>

<p>Though my mind was of too prosaic a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
turn to catch at any significance in a dream,
yet there was a strange, deep, solemn
tenderness in her voice and manner as she
related this vision, that impressed me. It
made my heart leap to hear her own sweet
lips pronounce her faith in me, and my
natural hopes and longings for life gathered
a new light and enthusiasm from her own
belief in our future salvation.</p>

<p>"Shipwrecked persons have been saved
by a dream before now," I replied, gravely.
"Many years ago a vessel called the <i>Mary</i>
went ashore on some rocks to the southward
of one of the Channel Islands. A few of
the crew managed to gain the rocks, where
they existed ten or twelve days without
water or any kind of food save limpets,
which only increased their thirst without
relieving their hunger. A vessel bound out
of Guernsey passed the rocks at a distance
too far away to observe the signals of distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
made by the perishing men. But the
son of the captain had twice dreamed that
there were persons dying on those rocks,
and so importuned his father to stand close
to them that the man with great reluctance
consented. In this way, and by a dream,
those sailors were saved. Though I do not,
as a rule, believe in dreams, I believe this
story to be true, and I believe in your
dream."</p>

<p>She remained silent, but the ship presently
giving a sudden lurch, she put her
hand on my arm to steady herself, and kept
it there. Had I dared I should have bent
my head and kissed the little hand. She
could not know how much she made me
love her by such actions as this.</p>

<p>"The boatswain has told me," she said,
after a short silence, "that you want to
save the ship. I asked him why? Are you
angry with me for being curious?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
"Not in the least. What did he
answer?"</p>

<p>"He said that you thought the owners
would recompense you for your fidelity, and
promote you in their service."</p>

<p>"Now how could he know this? I have
never spoken such thoughts to him."</p>

<p>"It would not be difficult to guess such a
wish."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I have any
right to expect promotion or recompense of
any kind from owners who send their ship
to sea so badly provisioned that the men
mutiny."</p>

<p>"But if the water gains upon the ship
you will not be able to save her?"</p>

<p>"No, she must sink."</p>

<p>"What will you do then?"</p>

<p>"Put you on shore or on board another
ship," I replied, laughing at my own
evasion, for I knew what she meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
"Oh, of course, if we do not reach the
shore we shall none of us be able to do
anything," she said, dropping her head, for
she stood close enough to the binnacle light
to enable me to see her movements and
almost catch the expression on her face.
"I mean what will you do when we get
ashore?"</p>

<p>"I must try to get another ship."</p>

<p>"To command?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear no! as second mate, if they'll
have me."</p>

<p>"If command of a ship were given you
would you accept it?"</p>

<p>"If I could, but I can't."</p>

<p>She asked quickly, "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I have not passed an examination
as master."</p>

<p>She was silent again, and I caught myself
listening eagerly to the sound of the pumping
going on on the main-deck and wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
at my own levity in the face of our
danger. But I could not help forgetting
a very great deal when she was at my side.</p>

<p>All at once it flashed upon me that her
father owned several ships, and that her
questions were preliminary to her offering
me the command of one of them.</p>

<p>I give you my honour that all recollection
of who and what she was, of her station on
shore, of her wealth as the old man's heiress,
had as absolutely gone out of my mind as if
the knowledge had never been imparted.
What she was to me&mdash;what love and the
wonderful association of danger and death
had endeared her to me as&mdash;was what she
was as she stood by my side, a sweet and
gentle woman whom my heart was drawing
closer and closer to every hour, whose life I
would have died to preserve, whose danger
made my own life a larger necessity to
me than I should have felt it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
A momentary emotion of disappointment,
a resentment whereof I knew not the meaning,
through lacking the leisure or the skill
to analyse it, made me turn and <span class="locked">say&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Would you like me to command one of
your ships, Miss Robertson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, promptly.</p>

<p>"As a recompense for my humane efforts
to preserve you from drowning?"</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand from my arm and
inclined her head to look me full in the face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, I never thought you would
speak to me like that."</p>

<p>"I want no recompense for what I have
done, Miss Robertson."</p>

<p>"I have not offered you any recompense."</p>

<p>"Let me feel," I said, "that you understand
it is possible for an English sailor
to do his duty without asking or expecting
any manner of reward. The Humane
Society's medals are not for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
"Why are you angry with me?" she
exclaimed, sinking her head, and speaking
with a little sob in her voice.</p>

<p>I was stirred to the heart by her broken
tones, and <span class="locked">answered&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I am not angry. I could not be angry
with you. I wish you to feel that what I
have done, that whatever I may do is ...
is...."</p>

<p>I faltered and stopped&mdash;an ignominious
break down! though I think it concealed
the true secret of my resentment.</p>

<p>I covered my confusion by taking her
hand, and resting it on my arm again.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," she said, "that all you
have done has been for my sake only&mdash;out
of humanity&mdash;that you would do as much
for anybody else?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, boldly.</p>

<p>Again she withdrew her hand and remained
silent, and I made up my mind not
to interrupt her thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
After a few moments she went to the
ship's side, and stood there; sometimes
looking at the stars, and sometimes at the
water that stretched away into the gloom
in heavy breaking seas.</p>

<p>The wind was singing shrilly up aloft,
but the sounds of the pumping ceased on
a sudden.</p>

<p>I awaited the approach of the boatswain
with inexpressible anxiety. After an interval
I saw his figure come up the poop
ladder.</p>

<p>"Pumps suck!" he roared out.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" I shouted. "Down with
you for grog all round," for the other two
were following the boatswain. But they
all came aft first and stood near the wheel,
blowing like whales, and Miss Robertson
joined the group.</p>

<p>"If it's no worse than this, bo'sun," I
exclaimed, "she'll do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
"Aye, she'll do, sir; but it's hard work.
My arms feel as though they wos tied up in
knots."</p>

<p>"So do mine," said the steward.</p>

<p>"Shall I take the wheel?" asked Cornish.</p>

<p>"No; go and get some grog and turn in,
all of you. I am as fresh as a lark, and
will stay here till twelve o'clock," I replied.</p>

<p>The steward at once shuffled below.</p>

<p>"Boatswain, ask Mr. Royle to let me take
the wheel," said Miss Robertson. "He has
been talking to me for the last half-hour
and sometimes held the wheel with one
hand. I am sure I can hold it."</p>

<p>"As you won't go below, Miss Robertson,
you shall steer; but I will stop by you,"
I said.</p>

<p>"That will be of no use!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Cornish smothered a laugh and walked
away.</p>

<p>"Now, bo'sun, down with you," I cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
"I'll have you up again shortly to sound
the well. But half an hour's sleep is something.
If you get knocked up, I lose half
the ship's company&mdash;two-thirds of it."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," he replied, with a prodigious
yawn. "You an' the lady 'll know
how to settle this here business of steering."</p>

<p>And off he went.</p>

<p>"You see how obedient these men are,
Miss Robertson. Why will you not obey
orders, and get some sleep?"</p>

<p>"I have offended you, Mr. Royle, and I
am very, very sorry."</p>

<p>"Let us make peace then," I said, holding
out my hand.</p>

<p>She took it; but when I had got her
hand, I would not let it go for some
moments.</p>

<p>She was leaving the deck in silence when
she came back and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"If we should have to leave this ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
suddenly, I should not like&mdash;it would make
me unhappy for ever to think of poor papa
left in her."</p>

<p>She spoke, poor girl, with a great effort.</p>

<p>I answered <span class="locked">immediately&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Any wish you may express shall be
carried out."</p>

<p>"He would go down in this ship without
a prayer said for him," she exclaimed,
sobbing.</p>

<p>"Will you leave this with me? I promise
you that no tenderness, no reverence,
no sincere sorrow shall be wanting."</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, you are a dear good friend
to me. God knows how lonely I should
have been without you&mdash;and yet&mdash;I made
you angry."</p>

<p>"Do not say that. What I do I do for
your safety&mdash;for your ultimate happiness&mdash;so
that when we say farewell to each other
on shore, I may feel that the trust which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
God gave me in you was honourably and
faithfully discharged. I desire, if our lives
are spared, that this memory may follow
me when all this scene is changed, and we
behold it again only in our dreams. I
should have told you my meaning just
now, but one cannot always express one's
thoughts."</p>

<p>"You have told me your meaning, and I
shall not forget it. God bless you!" she
exclaimed, in her calm, earnest voice, and
went slowly down into the cuddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>The wind still continued a brisk gale and
the sea very heavy. Yet overhead it was a
glorious night, and as the glass had risen
steadily, I was surprised to find the wild
weather holding on so long.</p>

<p>I busied my head with all kinds of
schemes to save the ship, and believed it
would be no hard matter to do so if the
water did not come into her more quickly
than she was now making it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were only two parts
of the ship's hold which we could get into:
namely, right forward in the fore peak, and
right aft down in the lazarette. If she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
strained a butt, or started any part of her
planking or outer skin, amidships or anywhere
in her bottom between these two
points, there would be no chance of getting
at the leak unless the cargo were slung out
of her.</p>

<p>But the leak could not be considered
very serious that did not run a greater
depth of water into the ship than under a
foot an hour; and with the Bermudas close
at hand and the weather promising fair, I
could still dare to think it possible, despite
the hopes and fears which alternately depressed
and elevated me, to bring the vessel
to port, all crippled and under-manned as
she was.</p>

<p>These speculations kept me busily thinking
until half-past eleven, on which I
bawled to the steward, who got up and
called the boatswain and Cornish, though
I only wanted the boatswain. Cornish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
thought it was midnight and his turn to
take the wheel, so he came aft. I resigned
my post, being anxious to get on the main-deck,
where I found the bo'sun in the act
of sounding the well, he having lost some
time in re-lighting the lamp, which had
burnt out.</p>

<p>He dropped the rod carefully and found
the water thirteen inches deep,&mdash;that was,
nine inches high in the pumps.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," said he; "she's
takin' of it at a foot an hour, no better and
no worse."</p>

<p>"Well, we must turn to," I exclaimed.
"We mustn't let it rise above a foot, as
every inch will make our work longer and
harder."</p>

<p>"If it stops at that, good and well," said
the boatswain. "But there's always a hif
in these here sinkin' cases. However,
there's time enough to croak when the worst
happens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
He called to the steward, and we all three
went to work and pumped vigorously, and
kept the handles grinding and clanking,
with now and again a spell of a couple of
minutes' rest between, until the pumps gave
out the throaty sound which told us that
the water was exhausted.</p>

<p>Though this proved beyond a doubt that,
providing the leak remained as it was, we
should be able to keep the water under, the
prospect before us of having to work the
pumps every hour was extremely disheartening;
all four of us required sleep to put us
right, and already our bones were aching
with weariness. Yet it was certain that we
should be able to obtain at the very best
but brief snatches of rest; and I for one did
not even promise myself so much, for I had
strong misgivings as to the condition of the
ship's bottom, and was prepared, at any
moment, to find the water gaining more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
rapidly upon us than we could pump it out,
though I kept my fears to myself.</p>

<p>I had been on deck now for four hours at
one stretch; so, leaving Cornish at the
wheel, I lay down on the steward's mattress
in the cuddy, whilst he seated himself on
the bench with his head upon the cuddy
table, and snored in that posture.</p>

<p>But we were all aroused again within the
hour by Cornish, who called to us down the
companion, and away we floundered, with
our eyes gummed up with sleep, to the
pumps, and wearily worked them like
miserable automatons.</p>

<p>The dawn found me again at the wheel,
having been there half an hour.</p>

<p>I scanned the broken desolate horizon in
the pale light creeping over it, but no ship
was in sight. The sea, though not nearly
so dangerous as it had been, was terribly
sloppy, short, and quick, and tumbled very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
often over the ship's sides, making the
decks, with the raffle that encumbered
them, look wretched.</p>

<p>I had not had my clothes off me for some
days, and the sense of personal discomfort
in no small degree aggravated the profound
feeling of weariness which ached like
rheumatism in my body and absolutely
stung in my legs. The skin of my face was
hard and dry with long exposure to the
terrible wind and the salt water it had
blown and dried upon it; and though my
underclothing was dry, yet it produced all
the sensation of dampness upon my skin,
and never in all my life had I felt so uncomfortable,
weary, and spiritless as I did
standing at the wheel when the dawn broke
and I looked abroad upon the rugged fields
of water, and found no vessel in sight to
inspire me with a moment's emotion of
hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
I was replaced at the wheel by the boatswain,
and took another turn at the pumps.
When this harassing job was ended, I went
into the forecastle, making my way thither
with much difficulty.</p>

<p>I had a sacred duty to perform, and now
that the daylight was come it was proper I
should go to work.</p>

<p>On entering the forecastle I looked around
me on the empty hammocks swinging from
the deck, and finding one that looked new
and clean, took it down and threw the
mattress and blankets out of it and folded
it up as a piece of canvas.</p>

<p>I then searched the carpenter's berth for
a sail needle, twine, and palm, which things,
together with the hammock, I took aft.</p>

<p>On reaching the cuddy I called Cornish,
whose services in this matter I preferred to
the steward's, and bid him follow me into
the cabin where the old man's body lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
When there, I closed the door and informed
him that we should bury the poor
old gentleman when the morning was more
advanced, and that I wished him to help
me to sew up the body in the hammock.</p>

<p>God knows I had rather that any man
should have undertaken this job than I;
but it was a duty I was bound to perform,
and I desired, for Miss Robertson's sake, that
it should be carried out with all the reverence
and tenderness that so rude and simple
a burial was susceptible of, and nothing
done to cause the least violence to her
feelings.</p>

<p>We spread the hammock open on the
deck, and lifted the body and placed it on
the hammock, and rolled a blanket over it.
A very great change had come over the
face of the corpse since death, and I do
not think I should have known it as the
kindly, dignified countenance, reverent with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
its white hair and beard, that had smiled
at me from the bunk and thanked me for
what I had done.</p>

<p>For what I had done!&mdash;alas! how mocking
was this memory now!&mdash;with what painful
cynicism did that lonely face illustrate the
power of man over the great issues of life
and death!</p>

<p>I brought the sides of the hammock to
meet over the corpse and held them while
Cornish passed the stitches. I then sent
him to find me a big holystone or any pieces
of iron, so as to sink the body, and he
brought some pieces of the stone, which I
secured in the clues at the foot of the
hammock.</p>

<p>We left the face exposed and raised the
body on to the bunk and covered it over;
after which I despatched Cornish for a carpenter's
short-stage I had noticed forward,
and which was in use for slinging the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
over the ship's side for scraping or painting
her. A grating would have answered our
purpose better, but the hatches were
battened down, the tarpaulins over them,
and there was no grating to be got at without
leaving the hatchway exposed.</p>

<p>I dressed this short-stage in the big
ensign, and placed it on the upper bunk
ready to be used, and then told Cornish
to stand by with the steward, and went
aft and knocked at Miss Robertson's
door.</p>

<p>My heart was in my throat, for this
mission was even more ungrateful to me
than the sewing up of the body had been,
and I was afraid that I should not be
able to address her tenderly enough, and
show her how truly I mourned for and
with her.</p>

<p>As I got no answer, I was leaving, wishing
her to obtain all the sleep she could, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
when I had gone a few paces she came out
and followed me.</p>

<p>"Did you knock just now, Mr. Royle?"
she asked.</p>

<p>I told her yes, but could not immediately
summon up courage enough to tell her why
I had knocked.</p>

<p>She looked at me inquiringly, and I began
to reproach myself for my weakness, and
still I could not address her; but seeing me
glance towards her father's cabin she understood
all on a sudden, and covered her face
with her hands.</p>

<p>"I have left his face uncovered for you
to kiss," I said, gently laying my hand on
her arm.</p>

<p>She went at once into his cabin, and I
closed the door upon her and waited outside.</p>

<p>She did not keep me long waiting. I
think, brave girl that she was, even amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
all her desolating sorrow, that she knew I
would wish the burial over so that we might
address ourselves again to the ship.</p>

<p>"I leave him to you now," she said.</p>

<p>I thought she meant that she would not
witness the funeral, and was glad that she
had so resolved, and I accordingly took her
hand to lead her away to her cabin.</p>

<p>"Let me be with you!" she exclaimed.
"Indeed, indeed, I am strong enough to
bear it. I should not be happy if I did not
know the moment when he left me, that I
might pray to God for him then."</p>

<p>"Be it so," I answered. "I will call you
when we are ready."</p>

<p>She left me; and Cornish and the
steward and I went into the cabin to complete
the mournful preparations.</p>

<p>I cased the body completely in the hammock,
and we then raised it up and laid it
upon the stage, which we had made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
answer for a stretcher, and over it I threw a
sheet, so that only the sheet and the ensign
were visible.</p>

<p>This done, I consulted with Cornish as to
what part of the deck we should choose in
order to tilt the body overboard. It is
generally the custom to rest the body near
the gangway, but the ship was rolling too
heavily to enable us to do this now, and
the main-deck was afloat, so we decided on
carrying the body right aft, and thither we
transported it, lodging the foot of the
stretcher on the rail abaft the port quarter-boat.</p>

<p>The boatswain removed his hat when he
saw the body, and the others imitated him.</p>

<p>I went below and told Miss Robertson
that all was ready, and took from among
the books belonging to the captain an old
thin volume containing the Office for the
Burial of Dead at Sea, printed in very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
type. It was fortunate that I had noticed
this slip of a book when overhauling Captain
Coxon's effects, for my own Prayer-Book
did not contain the office, and there
was no Church Service among the captain's
books.</p>

<p>I entreated Miss Robertson to reflect
before resolving to witness the burial. I told
her that her presence could do no good, and
faithfully assured her that prayers would be
read, and the sad little service conducted as
reverently and tenderly as my deep sympathy
and the respect which the others felt
for her could dictate.</p>

<p>She only answered that it would comfort
her to pray for him and herself at the
moment he was leaving her, and put her
hand into mine, and gently and with tearless
eyes, though with a world of sorrow in
her beautiful pale face, asked me to take
her on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Such grief was not to be argued with&mdash;indeed,
I felt it would be cruel to oppose
any fancy, however strange it seemed to me,
which might really solace her.</p>

<p>She started and stopped when she saw
the stretcher and the white sheet and the
outline beneath it, and her hand clasped
mine tightly; but she recovered herself and
we advanced, and then resolving that she
should not see the body leave the stretcher,
I procured a flag and placed it near the
after skylight and said she could kneel
there; which she did with her back turned
upon us.</p>

<p>I then whispered Cornish to watch me
and take note of the sign I should give him
to tilt the stretcher and to do it quickly;
after which I placed myself near the body
and began to read the service.</p>

<p>It was altogether a strange, impressive
scene, one that in a picture would, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
am sure, hold the eye for a long time;
but in the reality create an ineffaceable
memory.</p>

<p>The insecurity&mdash;the peril, I should prefer
to say&mdash;of our situation, heightened my own
feelings, and made me behold in the corpse
we were about to commit to the deep a sad
type and melancholy forerunner of our own
end. The ship, with her broken masts, her
streaming decks, her jib-boom gone, her one
sail swollen by the hoarse gale, plunging
and rolling amid the tumultuous seas that
foamed around and over her; the strong
man at the wheel, bareheaded, his hair
blown about by the wind, looking downwards
with a face full of blunt and honest
sorrow, and his lips moving as they repeated
the words I read; the motionless,
kneeling girl; the three of us standing near
the corpse; the still, dead burden on the
stretcher, waiting to be launched; the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
sky, and sun kindling into glory as it soared
above the eastern horizon: all these were
details which formed a picture the wildness
and strangeness of which no pen could
describe. They are all, as a vision, before
me as I write; but they make me know
how poor are words, and eloquence how
weak, when great realities and things
which have befallen many men are to be
described.</p>

<p>When I came to that part of the office
wherein it is directed that the body shall
be let fall into the sea, my heart beat
anxiously, for I feared that the girl would
look around and see what was done.</p>

<p>I gave the sign, and instantly Cornish
obeyed, and I thank God that the sullen
splash of the corpse was lost in the roar of a
sea bursting under the ship's counter.</p>

<p>Now that it was gone, the worst was
over; and in a short time I brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
service to an end, omitting many portions
which assuredly I had not skipped had not
time been precious to us.</p>

<p>I motioned to Cornish and the steward to
carry the stretcher away, and waited for
Miss Robertson to rise; but she remained
for some minutes on her knees, and when
she rose, the deck was clear.</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, and smiled softly,
though with a heart-broken expression in
her eyes, at the boatswain by way of thanking
him for his sympathy, and I then
conducted her below and left her at the
door of the cabin, <span class="locked">saying&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I have no words to tell you how I feel
for you. Pray God that those who are still
living may be spared, and be sure that
in His own good time He will comfort you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p>All that morning the gale continued fresh
and the sea dangerous. We found that the
ship was regularly making nine to ten
inches of water an hour; and after the
funeral we turned to and pumped her out
again.</p>

<p>But this heavy work, coupled with our
extreme anxiety and the perils and labour
we had gone through, was beginning to tell
heavily upon us. The steward showed
signs of what strength he had coming to
an end, and Cornish's face had a worn and
wasted look as of a man who has fasted
long. The boatswain supported this fatigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
best, and always went cheerfully to work,
and had encouraging words for us all.
As for me, what I suffered most from
was, strange to say, the eternal rolling of
the ship. At times it completely nauseated
me. Also it gave me a racking headache,
and occasionally the motion so bewildered
me that I was obliged to sit down and hold
my head in my hands until the dizziness
had passed.</p>

<p>I believe this feeling was the result of
over-work, long wakefulness, and preying
anxiety, which was hourly sapping my constitution.
Yet I was generally relieved by
even a quarter of an hour's sleep, but presently
was troubled again, and I grew to
dread the time when I should take the
wheel, for right aft the motion of the ship
was intensely felt by me, so much so that
on that morning, the vessel's stern falling
heavily into a hollow, I nearly fainted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and only saved myself from rolling on
the deck by clinging convulsively to the
wheel.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past eleven I had just gone
into the cuddy, after having had an hour's
spell at the pumps with the boatswain and
the steward, when I heard Cornish's voice
shouting down the companion, "A sail! a
sail!"</p>

<p>But a minute before I had felt so utterly
prostrated, that I should not have believed
myself capable of taking half-a-dozen steps
without a long rest between each. Yet
these magical words sent me rushing up
the companion ladder with as much speed
and energy as I should have been capable
of after a long night's refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>The moment Cornish saw me he pointed
like a mad man to the horizon on the
weather beam, and the ship's stern rising
at that moment, I clearly beheld the sails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of a vessel, though in what direction she
was going I could not tell by the naked
eye.</p>

<p>Both the boatswain and the other had
come running aft on hearing Cornish's
exclamation, and the steward, in the madness
of his eagerness, had swung himself
on to the mizzen rigging, and stood there
bawling, "Yonder's the ship! yonder's the
ship! Come up here, and you'll see her
plain enough!"</p>

<p>I got the telescope and pointed it at the
vessel, and found that she was heading
directly for us, steering due south, with the
gale upon her starboard quarter.</p>

<p>On this I cried out: "She's coming slap
at us, boys! Hurrah! Cornish, you were
the first to see her; thank you! thank
you!"</p>

<p>And I grasped his hand and shook it
wildly. I then seized the telescope, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
inspected the vessel again, and exclaimed,
while I held the glass to my <span class="locked">eye&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"She's a big ship, bo'sun. She's carrying
a main top-gallant sail, and there's a single
reef in her fore-topsail. She can't miss us!
She's coming right at us, hand over fist,
boys! Steward, go and tell Miss Robertson
to come on deck. Down with you and
belay that squalling. Do you think we're
blind?"</p>

<p>The small ensign was still alive, roaring
away just as we had hoisted and left it;
but in my excitement I did not think the
signal importunate enough, though surely
it was so; and rushing to the flag-locker,
I got out the book of signals, and sang out
to the boatswain to help me to bend on the
flags which I threw out, and which would
represent that we were sinking.</p>

<p>We hauled the ensign down, and ran up
the string of flags, and glorious they looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
in our eyes, as they streamed out in a semicircle,
showing their brilliant colours against
the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>Again I took the telescope, and set it on
the rail, and knelt to steady myself.</p>

<p>The hull of the ship was now half risen,
and as she came rolling and plunging over
the seas I could discern the vast space of
froth she was throwing up at her bows.
Dead on as she was, we could not tell
whether she had hoisted any flag at the
peak, and I hoped in mercy to us that she
would send up an answering pennant to the
royal mast-head, so that we might see it
and know that our signal was perceived.</p>

<p>But this was a foolish hope, only such a
one as bitter eager anxiety could coin. She
was coming right at us; she <i>could</i> not fail
to see us; what need to answer us yet when
a little patience, only a little patience, and
she would be within a biscuit's throw of us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Miss Robertson came on deck without
any covering on her head, and the wind
blew her hair away from its fastenings and
floated it out like a cloud of gold. She
held on to the rail and stared at the coming
ship with wild eyes and a frowning forehead,
while the steward, who had fallen
crazy with the sight of the ship, clambered
once more into the mizzen rigging, and
shouted and beckoned to the vessel as a
little child would.</p>

<p>It did not take me long, however, to
recover my own reason, the more especially
as I felt that we might require all the sense
we had when the ship rounded and hove to.
I could not, indeed, hope that they would
send a boat through such a sea; they would
lie by us and send a boat when the sea
moderated, which, to judge by the barometer
and the high and beaming sky, we might
expect to find that night or next morning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
and then we should require our senses,
not only to keep the pumps going, but to
enter the boat calmly and in an orderly
way, and help our rescuers to save our
lives.</p>

<p>The boatswain leaned against the companion
hatchway with his arms folded,
contemplating the approaching ship with a
wooden face. Variously and powerfully as
the spectacle of the vessel had affected
Cornish and Miss Robertson, and myself
and the steward, on the boatswain it had
scarcely produced any impression.</p>

<p>I know not what kind of misgiving came
into my mind as I looked from the coming
ship to his stolid face.</p>

<p>I had infinite confidence in this man's
judgment and bravery, and his lifelessness
on this occasion weighed down upon me
like a heavy presentiment, insomuch that
the cheery gratulatory words I was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to address to Miss Robertson died away on
my lips.</p>

<p>I should say that we had sighted this
vessel's upper sails when she was about
seventeen miles distant, and, therefore,
coming down upon us before a strong wind,
and helped onwards by the long running
seas, in less than half an hour her whole
figure was plain to us upon the water.</p>

<p>I examined her carefully through the
glass, striving to make out her nationality
by the cut of her aloft. I thought she had
the look of a Scotch ship, her hull being
after the pattern of the Aberdeen clippers,
such as I remembered them in the Australian
trade, painted green, and she was also
rigged with skysail-poles and a great
breadth of canvas.</p>

<p>I handed the glass to the boatswain, and
asked him what country he took her to be
of. After inspecting her, he said he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
think she was English; the colour of her
canvas looked foreign, but it was hard to
tell; we should see her colours presently.</p>

<p>As she approached, Miss Robertson's
excitement grew very great; not demonstrative&mdash;I
mean she did not cry out nor
gesticulate like the steward in the rigging;
it was visible, like a kind of madness, in
her eyes, in her swelling bosom, in a strange,
wonderful, brilliant smile upon her face,
such as a great actress might wear in a
play, but which we who observe it know to
be forced and unreal.</p>

<p>I ran below for the fur cap and coat, and
made her put them on, and then drew her
away from the ship's side and kept close to
her, even holding her by the hand for some
time, for I could not tell what effect the
sight of the ship might produce upon her
mind, already strung and weakened by privation
and cruel sorrow and peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
The vessel came rolling and plunging
down towards us before the wind, carrying
a sea on either quarter as high as
her main-brace bumpkins, and spreading
a great surface of foam before and around
her.</p>

<p>When she was about a couple of miles off
they let go the main top-gallant halliards
and clewed up the sail; and then the helm
was starboarded, which brought her bows
astern of us and gave her a sheer, by which
we saw that she was a fine barque, of at
least eight hundred tons burden.</p>

<p>At the same moment she hoisted Russian
colours.</p>

<p>I was bitterly disappointed when I saw
that flag. I should have been equally disappointed
by the sight of any other foreign
flag, unless it were the Stripes and Stars,
which floats over brave hearts and is a
signal to Englishmen as full of welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and promise almost as their own loved bit
of bunting.</p>

<p>I had hoped, God knows how earnestly,
that we should behold the English ensign
at the gaff end. Our chances of rescue by
a British ship were fifty to one as against
our chances of rescue by a foreigner. Cases,
indeed, have been known of ships commanded
by Englishmen sighting vessels in
distress and leaving them to their fate; but,
to the honour and glory of our calling, I
say that these cases make so brief a list
that no impartial-minded man will allow
them to weigh with him a moment when he
considers the vast number of instances of
pluck, humanity, and heroism which illustrate
and adorn the story of British naval
life.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with foreigners. I write
not with any foolish insular prejudice
against wooden shoes and continental connexions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
we cannot dispute good evidence.
Though I believe that the Russians make
fair sailors, and fight bravely on sea, why
was it that my heart sank when I saw that
flag? I say that the British flag is an
assurance to all distressed persons that what
can be done for them will be done for them,
and foreigners know this well, and would
sooner sight it when they are in peril than
their own colours, be those colours Dutch,
or French, or Spanish, or Danish, or Italian,
or Russian. But he must be a confident
man indeed who hopes anything from a
vessel sailing under a foreign flag when life
is to be saved at the risk of the lives of the
rescuers.</p>

<p>"He's goin' to round to!" exclaimed the
boatswain, who watched the movements of
ship with an unconcern absolutely phenomenal
to me even to recall now, when I
consider that the lives of us all might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
depended upon the issue of the stranger's
actions.</p>

<p>She went gracefully swooping and swashing
along the water, and I saw the hands
upon the deck aft standing by at the main-braces
to back the yards.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun!" I cried, "she means to heave
to&mdash;she won't leave us!"</p>

<p>He made no answer, but continued watching
her with an immovable face.</p>

<p>She passed under our stern not more than
a quarter of a mile distant, perhaps not so
far. There was a crowd of persons near
the wheel, some looking at us through
binocular glasses, others through telescopes.
There were a few women and children
among them.</p>

<p>Yet I could detect no hurry, no eagerness,
no excitement in their movements; they
appeared as imperturbable as Turks or Hollanders,
contemplating us as though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
were rather an object of curiosity than
in miserable, perishing distress.</p>

<p>I jumped upon the grating abaft the
wheel and waved my hat to them and
pointed to our signals. A man standing
near their starboard quarter-boat, whom,
by the way he looked aloft, I judged to
be the captain, flourished his hand in
reply.</p>

<p>I then, at the top of my voice and
through my hands, shouted, "We're sinking!
for God's sake stand by us!" On
which the same person held up his hand
again, though I do not believe he understood
or even heard what I said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had braced up the foreyards,
and as the vessel came round parallel
with us, at a distance of about two-thirds
of a mile, they backed the mainyards, and
in a few moments she lay steady, riding
finely upon the water and keeping her decks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
dry, though the seas were still splashing
over us freely.</p>

<p>Seeing now, as I believed, that she meant
to stand by us, all my excitement broke out
afresh. I cried out that we were saved, and
fell upon my knees and thanked God for
His mercy. Miss Robertson sobbed aloud,
and the steward came down out of the
rigging, and danced about the deck, exclaiming
wildly and extending his arms
towards the ship. Cornish retained his
grasp of the wheel, but could not remove
his eyes from the ship; the boatswain
alone remained perfectly tranquil, and even
angered me by his hard, unconcerned face.</p>

<p>"Good God!" I cried; "do you not
value your life? Have you nothing to say?
See, she is lying there, and will wait till
the sea moderates, and then fetch us on
board!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she may," he answered, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
it'll be time enough for me to go mad when
I <i>am</i> saved."</p>

<p>And he then folded his arms afresh, and
leaned against the rail, contemplating the
ship with the same extraordinary indifference.</p>

<p>They now hauled down the flag, and I
waited anxiously to see if they would hoist
the answering pennant to let us know they
understood our signal; but they made no
further sign that way, nor could I be sure,
therefore, that they understood the flags
we had hoisted; for though in those days
Marryatt's Code was in use among ships
of all nations, yet it often happened (as it
does now), that vessels, both British and
foreign, would, through the meanness of
their owners, be sent to sea with merely
the flags indicating their own number on
board, so that speaking one of these vessels
was like addressing a dumb person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The movements of the people on the
Russian barque were quite discernible by
the naked eye; and we all now, saving the
boatswain, watched her with rapt eagerness,
the steward stopping his mad antics to
grasp the poop rail, and gaze with devouring
eyes.</p>

<p>We did not know what they would do,
and, indeed, we scarcely knew what we had
to expect; for it was plain to us all that
a boat would stand but a poor chance in
that violent sea, and that we should run
a greater risk of losing our lives by quitting
the ship than by staying in her.</p>

<p>But would they not give us some sign,
some assurance that they meant to stand
by us?</p>

<p>The agony of my doubts of their intentions
was exquisite.</p>

<p>For some time she held her ground right
abreast of us; but our topsail being full,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
while the Russian was actually hove to,
we slowly began to reach ahead of her.</p>

<p>Seeing this, I cried out to Cornish to put
the helm hard down, and keep the sail flat
at the leech; but he had already anticipated
this order, though it was a useless
one; for the ship came to and fell off with
every sea, though the helm was hard down,
and before we could have got her to behave
as we wished, we should have been obliged
to clap some after sail upon her, which I
did not dare do, as we had only choice of
the mizzen and crossjack, and either of these
sails (both being large), would probably have
slewed her round head into the sea, and
thrown her dead and useless on our hands.</p>

<p>Seeing that we were slowly bringing the
Russian on to our lee quarter, I called out
in the hope of encouraging the <span class="locked">others&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No matter! she will let us draw ahead,
and then shorten sail and stand after us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
"Are they goin' to lower that boat?"
exclaimed the boatswain, suddenly starting
out of his apathetic manner.</p>

<p>There was a crowd of men round the starboard
davits where the quarter-boat hung,
but it was not until I brought the telescope
to bear upon them that I could see they
were holding an animated discussion.</p>

<p>The man who had motioned to us, and
whom I took to be master of the ship, stood
aft, in company with two others and a
woman, and gesticulated very vehemently,
sometimes pointing at us and sometimes
at the sea.</p>

<p>His meaning was intelligible enough to
me, but I was not disheartened; for though
it was plain that he was representing the
waves as too rough to permit them to lower
a boat, which was a conclusive sign, at
least, that those whom he addressed were
urging him to save us; yet his refusal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
no proof that he did not mean to keep by
us until it should be safe to send a boat
to our ship.</p>

<p>"What will they do, Mr. Royle?" exclaimed
Miss Robertson, speaking in a voice
sharpened by the terrible excitement under
which she laboured.</p>

<p>"They will not leave us," I answered.
"They are men&mdash;and it is enough that they
should have seen you among us to make
them stay. Oh!" I cried, "it is hard that
those waves do not subside! but patience.
The wind is lulling&mdash;we have a long spell
of daylight before us. Would to God she
were an English ship!&mdash;I should have no
fear then."</p>

<p>I again pointed the glass at the vessel.</p>

<p>The captain was still declaiming and
gesticulating; but the men had withdrawn
from the quarter-boat, and were watching
us over the bulwarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Since the boat was not to be lowered,
why did he continue arguing?</p>

<p>I watched him intently, watched him
until my eyes grew bleared and the metal
rim of the telescope seemed to burn into
the flesh around my eye.</p>

<p>I put the glass down and turned to glance
at the flags streaming over my head.</p>

<p>"There she goes! I knew it. They
never shows no pity!" exclaimed the boatswain,
in a deep voice.</p>

<p>I looked and saw the figures of the men
hauling on the lee main-braces.</p>

<p>The yards swung round; the vessel's
head paid off; they squared away forward,
and in a few minutes her stern was at us,
and she went away solemnly, rolling and
plunging; the main top-gallant sail being
sheeted home and the yard hoisted as she
surged forward on her course.</p>

<p>We remained staring after her&mdash;no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
speaking&mdash;no one believing in the reality of
what he beheld.</p>

<p>Of all the trials that had befallen us, this
was the worst.</p>

<p>Of all the terrible, cruel disappointments
that can afflict suffering people, none, <i>none</i>
in all the hideous catalogue, is more deadly,
more unendurable, more frightful to endure
than that which it was our doom then to
feel. To witness our salvation at hand and
then to miss it; to have been buoyed up
with hope unspeakable; to taste in the
promise of rescue the joy of renovated life;
to believe that our suffering was at an end,
and that in a short time we should be
among sympathetic rescuers, looking back
with shudders upon the perils from which
we had been snatched&mdash;to have felt all this,
and then to be deceived!</p>

<p>I thought my heart would burst. I tried
to speak, but my tongue clove to the roof of
my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
When the steward saw that we were
abandoned, he uttered a loud scream and
rushed headlong down into the cuddy.</p>

<p>I took no notice of him.</p>

<p>Cornish ran from the wheel, and springing
on to the rail, shook his fist at the
departing vessel, raving, and cursing her
with horrible, blasphemous words, black in
the face with his mad and useless rage.</p>

<p>The boatswain took his place and grasped
the wheel, never speaking a word.</p>

<p>I was aroused from the stupor that had
come over me, the effect of excessive
emotion, by Miss Robertson putting her
hand in mine.</p>

<p>"Be brave!" she whispered, with her
mouth close to my ear. "God is with us
still. My dead father would not deceive
me. We shall be saved yet. Have courage,
and be your own true self again!"</p>

<p>I looked into her shining eyes, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
which all the excitement that had fired
them while the Russian remained hove to,
had departed. There was a beautiful
tranquillity, there was a courage heaven-inspired,
there was a soft and hopeful smile
upon her pale face, which fell upon the
tempest in my breast and stilled it.</p>

<p>God had given her this influence over
me, and I yielded to it as though He Himself
had commanded me.</p>

<p>All her own troubles came before me, all
her own bitter trials, her miserable bereavement;
and as I heard her sweet voice bidding
me have courage, and beheld her
smiling upon me out of her deep faith in
her simple, sacred dream, I caught up both
her hands and bent my head over them and
wept.</p>

<p>"Cornish!" I cried, recovering myself,
and seizing the man by the arm as he stood
shouting at the fast-lessening ship, "what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
is the use of those oaths? let them go their
ways&mdash;the pitiless cowards. We are Englishmen,
and our lives are still our own.
Come, brave companion! we have all undergone
too much to permit this trial to break
us. See this lady! she swears that we shall
be saved yet. Be of her heart and mine
and the bo'sun's there, and help us to make
another fight for it. Come!"</p>

<p>He suffered me to pull him off his perilous
perch, and then sat himself down upon a
coil of rope trembling all over, and hid his
face in his hands.</p>

<p>But a new trouble awaited me.</p>

<p>At this moment the steward came staggering
up the companion ladder, his face
purple, his eyes protruding, and talking
loudly and incoherently. He clasped the
sea-chest belonging to himself, which certainly
was of greater weight than he in his
enfeebled state would have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
bear had he not been mad. The chest was
corded, and he had no doubt packed it.</p>

<p>He rushed to the ship's side and pitched
the chest overboard, and was in the act of
springing on to the rail, meaning to fling
himself into the sea, when I caught hold of
him, and using more force than I was conscious
of, dragged him backward so violently
that his head struck the deck like
a cannon shot, and he lay motionless and
insensible.</p>

<p>"That's the best thing that could have
happened to him," exclaimed the boatswain.
"Let him lie a bit. He'll come to,
and maybe leave his craze behind him. It
wouldn't be the fust time I've seen a daft
man knocked sensible."</p>

<p>And then, coolly biting a chew out of a

replaced in his breeches pocket, he <span class="locked">added&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Jim, come and lay hold of this here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
wheel, will yer, while me and Mr. Royle
pumps the ship out!"</p>

<p>Cornish got up and took the boatswain's
place.</p>

<p>"I can help you to pump, Mr. Royle!"
said Miss Robertson.</p>

<p>The boatswain laughed.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless your dear 'art, miss, what
next?" he cried. "No, no; you stand by
here ready to knock this steward down agin
if he shows hisself anxious to swim arter the
Roosian. We'll see what water the ship's
a-makin', and if she shows herself obstinate,
as I rayther think she will, why, we'll all
turn to and leave her. For you've got to
deal with a bad ship as you would with a
bad wife: use every genteel persuasion fust,
and if that won't alter her, there's nothen
for it but to grease your boots, oil your hair,
and po-litely walk out."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>There being but two of us now to work the
pumps, it was more than we could do to
keep them going. We plied them, with a
brief spell between, and then my arms fell
to my side, and I told the boatswain I
could pump no more.</p>

<p>He sounded the well and made six inches.</p>

<p>"There's only two inches left that we can
get out of her," said he; "and they'll do
no harm."</p>

<p>On which we quitted the main-deck and
came into the cuddy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle," he said, seating himself on
the edge of the table, "we shall have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
leave this ship if we aren't taken off her.
I reckon it'll require twelve feet o' water to
sink her, allowin' for there being a deal o'
wood in the cargo; and maybe she won't
go down at that. However, we'll say twelve
feet, and supposin' we lets her be, she'll
give us, if you like, eight or nine hours
afore settlin'. I'm not saying as we ought
to leave her; but I'm lookin' at you, sir,
and see that you're werry nigh knocked up;
Cornish is about a quarter o' the man he
was; an' as to the bloomin' steward, he's as
good as drownded, no better and no worse.
We shall take one spell too many at them
pumps and fall down under it an' never get
up agin. Wot we had best do is to keep a
look all around for wessels, get that there
quarter-boat ready for lowerin', and stand
by to leave the ship when the sea calms.
You know how Bermuda bears, don't you,
sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
"I can find out to-night. It is too late to
get sights now."</p>

<p>"I think," he returned, "that our lives
'll be as safe in the boat as they are on
board this ship, an' a trifle safer. I've been
watching this wessel a good deal, and my
belief is that wos another gale to strike her,
she'd make one o' her long plunges and go
all to pieces like a pack o' cards when she
got to the bottom o' the walley o' water.
Of course, if this sea don't calm, we must
make shift to keep her afloat until it do.
You'll excuse me for talkin' as though I
wos dictatin'. I'm just givin' you the
thoughts that come into my head whilst we
wos pumpin'."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," I replied; "I
am only thinking of the size of the quarter-boat;
whether she isn't too small for five
persons?"</p>

<p>"Not she! I'll get a bit of a mast rigged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
up in her and it'll go hard if we don't get
four mile an hour out of her somehows.
How fur might the Bermuda Islands be
off?"</p>

<p>I answered, after reflecting some moments,
that they would probably be distant
from the ship between 250 and 300 miles.</p>

<p>"We should get pretty near 'em in three
days," said he, "if the wind blew that way.
Will you go an' tell the young lady what
we're thinkin' o' doing while I overhauls
the boat an' see what's wantin' in her?
One good job is, we shan't have to put
off through the ship sinkin' all of a heap.
There's a long warning given us, and I
can't help thinkin' that the stormy
weather's blown hisself out, for the sky
looks to me to have a regular set fair blue
in it."</p>

<p>He went on to the main-deck. I inspected
the glass, which I found had risen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
since I last looked at it. This, coupled with
the brilliant sky and glorious sunshine and
the diminishing motion of the ship, cheered
me somewhat, though I looked forward
with misgiving to leaving the ship, having
upon me the memory of the sufferings
endured by shipwrecked men in this lonely
condition, and remembering that Mary
Robertson would be one of us, and have to
share in any privations that might befall us.</p>

<p>At the same time, it was quite clear to me
that the boatswain, Cornish, and myself
would never, with our failing strength, be
able to keep the ship afloat; and for Miss
Robertson's sake, therefore, it was my duty
to put a cheerful face upon the melancholy
alternative.</p>

<p>When I reached the poop the first thing
I beheld was the Russian barque, now a
square of gleaming white upon the southern
horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
I quickly averted my eyes from the
shameful object, and saw that the steward
had recovered from his swoon and was
squatting against the companion counting
his fingers and smiling at them.</p>

<p>Miss Robertson was steering the ship,
while Cornish lay extended along the deck,
his head pillowed on a flag.</p>

<p>The wind (as by the appearance of the
weather I might have anticipated, had my
mind been free to speculate on such things)
had dropped suddenly, and was now a
gentle breeze, and the sea was subsiding
rapidly. Indeed, a most golden, glorious
afternoon had set in, with a promise of a
hot and breathless night.</p>

<p>I approached Miss Robertson, and asked
her what was the matter with Cornish.</p>

<p>"I noticed him reeling at the wheel,"
she answered, "with his face quite white.
I put a flag for his head, and told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lie down. I called to you, but you did
not hear me; and I have been waiting
to see you that you might get him some
brandy."</p>

<p>I found that the boatswain had not yet
come aft, and at once went below to procure
a dram for Cornish. I returned and
knelt by his side, and was startled to perceive
that his eyeballs were turned up, and
his hands and teeth clenched, as though he
were convulsed. Sharp tremors ran through
his body, and he made no reply nor
appeared to hear me, though I called his
name several times.</p>

<p>Believing that he was dying, I shouted to
the boatswain, who came immediately.</p>

<p>The moment he looked at Cornish he
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"God knows what ails the poor creature!"
I cried. "Lift his head, that I
may get some brandy into his mouth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
The boatswain raised him by the
shoulders, but his head hung back like a
dead man's. I drew out my knife and
inserted the blade between his teeth, and by
this means contrived to introduce some
brandy into his mouth, but it bubbled back
again, which was a terrible sign, I thought;
and still the tremors shook his poor body,
and the eyes remained upturned, making
the face most ghastly to see.</p>

<p>"It's his heart broke," exclaimed the
boatswain, in a tremulous voice. "Jim,
what's the matter with 'ee, mate? You're
not goin' to let the sight o' that Roosian
murderer kill you? Come, come! God
Almighty knows we've all had a hard fight
for it, but we're not beat yet, lad. 'Tis but
another spell o' waitin', and it'll come
right presently. Don't let a gale o' wind
knock the breath out o' you. What man as
goes to sea but meets with reverses like this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
here? Swaller the brandy, Jim!... My
God! Mr. Royle, he's dyin'!"</p>

<p>As he said this Cornish threw up his
arms and stiffened out his body. So strong
was his dying action that he knocked the
glass of brandy out of my hand and threw
me backwards some paces. The pupils of
his eyes rolled down, and a film came over
them; he uttered something in a hoarse
whisper, and lay dead on the boatswain's
knee.</p>

<p>I glanced at Miss Robertson. Her lips
were tightly compressed, otherwise the
heroic girl showed no emotion.</p>

<p>The boatswain drew a deep breath and let
the dead man's head fall gently on the flag.</p>

<p>"For Miss Robertson's sake," I whispered,
"let us carry him forward."</p>

<p>He acquiesced in silence, and we bore
the body off the poop and laid it on the
fore-hatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
"There will be no need to bury him,"
said I.</p>

<p>"No need and no time, sir. I trust God'll
be merciful to the poor sailor when he's
called up. He was made bad by them
others, sir. His heart wasn't wrong,"
replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>I procured a blanket from the forecastle
and covered the body with it, and we
then walked back to the poop slowly and
without speaking.</p>

<p>I felt the death of this man keenly. He
had worked well, confronted danger cheerfully;
he had atoned, in his untutored
fashion, for the wrongs he had taken a part
in&mdash;besides, the fellowship of peril was a tie
upon us all, not to be sundered without a
pang, which our hearts never would have
felt had fate dealt otherwise with us.</p>

<p>I stopped a moment with the boatswain
to look at the steward before joining Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Robertson. To many, I believe this spectacle
of idiocy would have been more
affecting than Cornish's death. He was
tracing figures, such as circles and crosses,
with his fore finger on the deck, smiling
vacantly meanwhile, and now and then
looking around him with rolling, unmeaning
eyes.</p>

<p>"How is it with you, my man?" I said.</p>

<p>He gazed at me very earnestly, rose to
his feet, and, taking my arm, drew me a
short distance away from the boatswain.</p>

<p>"A ship passed us just now, sir," he
exclaimed in a whisper, and with a profoundly
confidential air. "Did you see
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, steward, I saw her."</p>

<p>"A word in your ear, sir&mdash;<i>mum!</i> that's
the straight tip. Do you see? I was tired
of this ship, sir&mdash;tired of being afraid of
drowning. I put myself on board that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
vessel, <i>and there I am now, sir</i>. But
hush! do you know I cannot talk to them&mdash;they're
furriners! Roosians, sir, by the
living cock! that's my oath, and it crows
every morning in my back garden."</p>

<p>He struck me softly on the waistcoat,
and fell back a step, with his finger on
his lip.</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "I understand. Sit down
again and go on drawing on the deck, and
then they'll think you're lost in study and
not trouble you."</p>

<p>"Right, my lord&mdash;your lordship's 'umble
servant," answered the poor creature,
making me a low bow; and with a lofty
and dignified air he resumed his place on
the deck near the companion.</p>

<p>"Wot was he sayin'?" inquired the
boatswain.</p>

<p>"He is quite imbecile. He thinks he
is on board the Russian," I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
"Well, that's a comfort," said the boatswain.
"He'll not be tryin' to swim arter
her agin."</p>

<p>"Miss Robertson," I exclaimed, "you
need not remain at the wheel. There is so
little wind now that the ship may be left to
herself."</p>

<p>Saving which I made the wheel fast and
led her to one of the skylights.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," said I, "will you fetch us
something to eat and drink out of the
pantry? Open a tin of meat, and get some
biscuit and wine. This may prove our last
meal on board the <i>Grosvenor</i>," I added to
Miss Robertson, as the boatswain left us.</p>

<p>She looked at me inquiringly, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>"Before we knew," I continued, "that
poor Cornish was dying, the boatswain and
I resolved that we should all of us leave the
ship. We have no longer the strength to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
man the pumps. The water is coming in
at the rate of a foot an hour, and we have
found latterly that even three of us cannot
pump more at a time out of her than six or
seven inches, and every spell at the pumps
leaves us more exhausted. But even though
we had hesitated to leave her, yet now that
Cornish is gone and the steward has fallen
imbecile, we have no alternative."</p>

<p>"I understand," she said, glancing at
the boat and compressing her lip.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid&mdash;you who have
shown more heart and courage than all
of us put together?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am not much afraid. I believe
that God is looking down upon us, and that
He will preserve us. But," she cried,
taking a short breath, and clasping her
hands convulsively, "it will be very, very
lonely on the great sea in that little
boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
"Why more lonely in that little boat
than on this broken and sinking ship? I
believe with you that God is looking down
upon us, and that He has given us that
pure and beautiful sky as an encouragement
and a promise. Contrast the sea now with
what it was this morning. In a few hours
hence it will be calm; and believe me
when I say that we shall be a thousandfold
safer in that boat than we are in this
strained and leaking ship. Even while we
talk now the water is creeping into the
hold, and every hour will make her sink
deeper and deeper until she disappears
beneath the surface. On the other hand,
we may have many days together of this
fine weather. I will steer the boat for the
Bermuda Islands, which we cannot miss by
heading the boat west, even if I should lack
the means of ascertaining our exact whereabouts,
which you may trust me will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the case. Moreover, the chance of our
being rescued by a passing ship will be
much greater when we are in the boat than
it is while we remain here; for no ship,
though she were commanded by a savage,
would refuse to pick a boat up and take its
occupants on board; whereas vessels, as we
have already discovered to our cost, will
sight distressed ships and leave them to
shift for themselves."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt you are right," she
replied, with a plaintive smile. "I should
not say or do anything to oppose you.
And believe me," she exclaimed earnestly,
"that I do not think more of my own life
than of that of my companions. Death is
not so terrible but that we may meet it,
if God wills, calmly. And I would rather
die at once, Mr. Royle, than win a few
short years of life on hard and bitter
terms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
She looked at the steward as she spoke,
and an expression of beautiful pity came
into her face.</p>

<p>"Miss Robertson," I said, "in my heart
I am pledged to save your life. If you die,
we both die!&mdash;of that be sure."</p>

<p>"I know what I owe you," she answered,
in a low and broken voice. "I know that
my life is yours, won by you from the very
jaws of death, soothed and supported by
you afterwards. What my gratitude is
only God knows. I have no words to tell
you."</p>

<p>"Do you give me the life I have saved?"
I asked, wondering at my own breathless
voice as I questioned her.</p>

<p>"I do," she replied firmly, lifting up her
eyes and looking at me.</p>

<p>"Do you give it to me because your
sweet and generous gratitude makes you
think it my due?&mdash;not knowing I am poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
not remembering that my station in life is
humble, without a question as to my
past?"</p>

<p>"I give it to you because I love you!"
she answered, extending her hand.</p>

<p>I drew her towards me and kissed her
forehead.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Mary darling, for your
faith in me! God bless you for your priceless
gift of your love to me! Living or
dead, dearest, we are one!"</p>

<p>And she, as though to seal these words
which our danger invested with an entrancing
mysteriousness, raised my hand to
her spotless lips, and then held it for some
moments to her heart.</p>

<p>The boatswain, coming up the poop
ladder, saw her holding my hand. He
approached us slowly, and in silence; and
putting down the tray, which he had
heaped with sailor-like profusion with food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
enough for a dozen persons, stood looking
on us thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle," he said, in a deliberate
voice, "you'll excuse me for sayin' of it,
but, sir, you've found her out?"</p>

<p>"I have, bo'sun."</p>

<p>"You've found her out, sir, as the truest-hearted
gell as ever did duty as a darter?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"I've watched her, and know her to
be British&mdash;true oak-seasoned, by God
Almighty, as does this sort o' work better
nor Time! You've found her out, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is true, bo'sun."</p>

<p>"And you, miss," he exclaimed, in the
same deliberate voice, "have found <i>him</i>
out?"</p>

<p>She looked downwards with a little blush.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, and you, miss," he continued,
"I'm not goin' to say nothen agin
this being the right time to find each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
out in. It's Almighty Providence as brings
these here matters to pass, and it's in times
o' danger as love speaks out strongest,
turnin' the heart into a speakin' trumpet
and hailin' with a loud and tremendious
woice. Wot I wur goin' to say is this: that
in Mr. Royle I've seen the love for a long
while past burnin' and strugglin', and sometimes
hidin' of itself, and then burstin' up
afresh, like a flare aboard o' a sinkin' ketch
on a windy night; and in you, miss, I've
likewise seen tokens as 'ud ha' made me up
and speak my joy days an' days ago, had it
been <i>my</i> consarn to attend to 'em. I say,
that now as we're sinkin' without at all
meanin' to drown, with no wun but God
Almighty to see us, this is the properest
time for you to have found each other
out in. Mr. Royle, your hand, sir; miss,
yours. I say, God bless you! Whilst we
have breath we'll keep the boat afloat; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
if it's not to be, still I'll say, God bless
you!"</p>

<p>He shook us heartily by the hand, looked
hard at the poor steward, as though he
would shake hands with him too; then
walked aft, hauled down the signals,
stepped into the cuddy, returned with the
large ensign, bent it on to the halliards, and
ran it up to the gaff-end.</p>

<p>"That," said he, returning and looking
up proudly at the flag, "is to let them as it
may consarn know that we're not dead yet.
Now, sir, shall I pipe to dinner?"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p>I think the boatswain was right.</p>

<p>It was no season for love-making; but it
was surely a fitting moment "for finding
each other out in."</p>

<p>I can say this&mdash;and God knows never was
there less bombast in such a thought than
there was in mine: that when I looked
round upon the sea and then upon my
beloved companion, I felt that I would
rather have chosen death with her love
to bless me in the end, than life without
knowledge of her.</p>

<p>I put food before the steward and induced
him to eat; but it was pitiful to see his
silly, instinctive ways, no reason in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
nothing but a mechanical guiding, with
foolish fleeting smiles upon his pale face.</p>

<p>I thought of that wife of his whose letter
he had wept over, and his child, and
scarcely knew whether it had not been
better for him and them that he should
have died than return to them a broken-down,
puling imbecile.</p>

<p>I said as much to Mary, but the tender
heart would not agree with me.</p>

<p>"Whilst there is life there is hope," she
answered softly. "Should God permit us
to reach home, I will see that the poor
fellow is well cared for. It may be that
when all these horrors have passed his mind
will recover its strength. Our trials are
<i>very</i> hard. When I saw that Russian ship
I thought my own brain would go."</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her forehead,
and an expression of suffering, provoked by
memory, came into her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
We despatched our meal, and I went
on to the main-deck to sound the well.
I found two feet of water in the hold, and
I came back and gave the boatswain the
soundings, who recommended that we
should at once turn to and get the boat
ready.</p>

<p>I said to him, as he clambered into the
boat for the purpose of overhauling her, that
I fully believed that a special Providence
was watching over us, and that we might
confidently hope God would not abandon us
now.</p>

<p>"If the men had not chased us in this
boat," I continued, "what chance should
we have to save our lives? The other boat
is useless, and we should never have been
able to repair her in time to get away from
the ship. Then look at the weather! I
have predicted a dead calm to-night, and
already the wind is gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
"Yes, everything's happened for the
best," he replied. "I only wish poor Jim's
life had been saved. It's a'most like leavin'
of him to drown to go away without buryin'
him; and yet I know there'd be no use in
puttin' him overboard. There's been a deal
o' precious human life wasted since we left
the Channel; and who are the murderers?
Wy, the owners. It's all come through their
sendin' the ship to sea with rotten stores.
A few dirty pounds 'ud ha' saved all this."</p>

<p>We had never yet had the leisure to
inspect the stores with which the mutineers
had furnished the quarter-boat, and we now
found, in spite of their having shifted a lot
of the provisions out of her into the long-boat
before starting in pursuit of us, that
there was still an abundance left: four kegs
of water, several tins of cuddy bread, preserved
meat and fruits, sugar, flour, and
other things, not to mention such items as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
boxes of lucifer-matches, fishing tackle, a
burning-glass, a quantity of tools and nails;
in a word, everything which men in the condition
they had hoped to find themselves in
might stand in need of to support life.
Indeed, the foresight illustrated by the
provisioning of this boat was truly remarkable,
the only things they had omitted
being a mast and sail, it having been
their intention to keep this boat in tow of
the other. I even found that they had
furnished the boat with the oars belonging
to the disabled quarter-boat in addition to
those of her own.</p>

<p>However, the boat was not yet stocked to
my satisfaction. I therefore repaired to my
cabin and procured the boat's compass,
some charts, a sextant, and other necessary
articles, such as the "Nautical Almanack,"
and pencils and paper wherewith to work
out my observations, which articles I placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
very carefully in the locker in the stern-sheets
of the boat.</p>

<p>I allowed Mary to help me, that the occupation
might divert her mind from the overwhelming
thoughts which the gradual settling
of the ship on which we stood must
have excited in the strongest and bravest
mind; and, indeed, I worked busily and
eagerly to guard myself against any terror
that might come upon me. She it was who
suggested that we should provide ourselves
with lamps and oil; and I shipped a lantern
to hoist at our mast-head when the darkness
came, and the bull's-eye lamp to enable
me to work out observations of the stars,
which I intended to make when the night
fell. To all these things, which, sounding
numerous, in reality occupied but little
space, I added a can of oil, meshes for
the lamps, top-coats, oilskins, and rugs to
protect us at night, so that the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
was well advanced before we had ended our
preparations. Meanwhile, the boatswain
had stepped a top-gallant stun'sail boom to
serve us for a mast, well stayed, with a
block and halliards at the mast-head to
serve for hoisting a flag or lantern, and a
spare top-gallant stun'sail to act as a sail.</p>

<p>By this time the wind had completely
died away; a peaceful deep blue sky
stretched from horizon to horizon; and the
agitation of the sea had subsided into a
long and silent swell, which washed up
against the ship's sides, scarcely causing
her to roll, so deep had she sunk in the
water.</p>

<p>I now thought it high time to lower the
boat and bring her alongside, as our calculations
of the length of time to be occupied
by the ship in sinking might be falsified to
our destruction by her suddenly going stern
down with us on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
We therefore lowered the boat, and got
the gangway ladder over the side.</p>

<p>The boatswain got into the boat first
to help Mary into her. I then took the
steward by the arms and brought him along
smartly, as there was danger in keeping the
boat washing against the ship's side. He
resisted at first, and only smiled vacantly
when I threatened to leave him; but on the
boatswain crying out that his wife was
waiting for him, the poor idiot got himself
together with a scramble, and went so
hastily over the gangway that he very
narrowly escaped a ducking.</p>

<p>I paused a moment at the gangway and
looked around, striving to remember if there
was anything we had forgotten which would
be of some use to us. Mary watched me
anxiously, and called to me by my Christian
name, at the same time extending her arms.
I would not keep her in suspense a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and at once dropped into the boat. She
grasped and fondled my hand, and drew me
close beside her.</p>

<p>"I should have gone on board again had
you delayed coming," she whispered.</p>

<p>The boatswain shoved the boat's head off,
and we each shipped an oar and pulled the
boat about a quarter of a mile away from
the ship; and then, from a strange and wild
curiosity to behold the ship sink, and still
in our hearts clinging to her, not only
as the home wherein we had found shelter
for many days past, but as the only visible
object in all the stupendous reach of waters,
we threw in the oars and sat watching her.</p>

<p>She had now sunk as deep as her main-chains,
and was but a little higher out of
water than the hull from which we had
rescued Mary and her father. It was
strange to behold her even from a short
distance and note her littleness in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
with the immensity of the deep
on which she rested, and recall the terrible
seas she had braved and triumphed over.</p>

<p>Few sailors can behold the ship in which
they have sailed sinking before their eyes
without the same emotion of distress and
pity almost which the spectacle of a drowning
man excites in them. She has grown a
familiar name, a familiar object; thus far
she has borne them in safety; she has been
rudely beaten, and yet has done her duty;
but the tempest has broken her down at
last; all the beauty is shorn from her; she
is weary with the long and dreadful struggle
with the vast forces that Nature arrayed
against her; she sinks, a desolate abandoned
thing in mid-ocean, carrying with
her a thousand memories, which surge up
in the heart with the pain of a strong man's
tears.</p>

<p>I looked from the ship to realize our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
position. Perhaps not yet could it be
keenly felt, for the ship was still a visible
object for us to hold on by; and yet, turning
my eyes away to the far reaches of the
horizon, at one moment borne high on the
summit of the ocean swell, which appeared
mountainous when felt in and viewed from
the boat, then sinking deep in the hollow,
so that the near ship was hidden from us&mdash;the
supreme loneliness of our situation,
our helplessness, and the fragility and
diminutiveness of the structure on which
our lives depended, came home to me with
the pain and wonder of a shock.</p>

<p>Our boat, however, was new this voyage,
with a good beam, and showing a tolerably
bold side, considering her dimensions and
freight. Of the two quarter-boats with
which the <i>Grosvenor</i> had been furnished,
this was the larger and the stronger built,
and for this reason had been chosen by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Stevens. I could not hope, indeed, that
she would live a moment in anything of
a sea; but she was certainly stout enough
to carry us to the Bermudas, providing the
weather remained moderate.</p>

<p>It was now six o'clock. I said to the
<span class="locked">boatswain&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Every hour of this weather is valuable
to us. There is no reason why we should
stay here."</p>

<p>"I should like to see her sink, Mr. Royle;
I should like to know that poor Jim found
a regular coffin in her," he answered. "We
can't make no headway with the sail, and
I don't recommend rowin' for the two or
three mile we can fetch with the oars.
It 'ud be wurse nor pumpin'!"</p>

<p>He was right. When I reflected I was
quite sure I should not, in my exhausted
state, be able to handle one of the big oars
for even five minutes at a stretch; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
admitting that I <i>had</i> been strong enough to
row for a couple of hours, yet the result to
have been obtained could not have been
important enough to justify the serious
labour.</p>

<p>The steward all this time sat perfectly
quiet in the bottom of the boat, with his
back against the mast. He paid no attention
to us when we spoke, nor looked
around him, though sometimes he would fix
his eyes vacantly on the sky as if his shattered
mind found relief in contemplating
the void. I was heartily glad to find him
quiet, though I took care to watch him, for
it was difficult to tell whether his imbecility
was not counterfeited by his madness, to
throw us off our guard, and furnish him
with an opportunity to play us and himself
some deadly trick.</p>

<p>As some hours had elapsed since we had
tasted food, I opened a tin of meat and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
a meal. The boatswain ate heartily,
and so did the steward; but I could not
prevail upon Mary to take more than a
biscuit and some sherry and water.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the evening approached, our
position affected her more deeply, and very
often, after she had cast her eyes towards
the horizon, I would see her lips whispering
a prayer, and feel her hand tightening on
mine.</p>

<p>The ship still floated, but she was so low
in the water that I every minute expected
to see her vanish. The water was above
her main-chains, and I could only attribute
her obstinacy in not sinking to the great
quantity of wood&mdash;both in cases and goods&mdash;which
composed her cargo.</p>

<p>The sun was now quite close to the
horizon, branding the ocean with a purple
glare, but itself descending into a cloudless
sky. I cannot express how majestic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
wonderful the great orb looked to us who
were almost level with the water. Its disc
seemed vaster than I had ever before seen
it, and there was something sublimely
solemn in the loneliness of its descent. All
the sky about it, and far to the south and
north, was changed into the colour of gold
by its lustre; and over our heads the
heavens were an exquisite tender green,
which melted in the east into a dark blue.</p>

<p>I was telling Mary that ere the sun sank
again we might be on board a ship, and
whispering any words of encouragement
and hope to her, when I was startled by the
boatswain crying, "Now she's gone! Look
at her!"</p>

<p>I turned my eyes towards the ship, and
could scarcely credit my senses when I
found that her hull had vanished, and that
nothing was to be seen of her but her spars,
which were all aslant sternwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
I held my breath as I saw the masts sink
lower and lower. First the crossjack-yard
was submerged, then the gaff with the
ensign hanging dead at the peak, then the
mainyard; presently only the main-topmast
cross-trees were visible, a dark cross
upon the water: they vanished; at the
same moment the sun disappeared behind
the horizon; and now we were alone on the
great, breathing deep, with all the eastern
sky growing dark as we watched.</p>

<p>"It's all over!" said the boatswain,
breaking the silence, and speaking in a
hollow tone. "No livin' man'll ever see
the <i>Grosvenor</i> agin!"</p>

<p>Mary shivered and leaned against me. I
took up a rug and folded it round her, and
kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>The boatswain had turned his back upon
us, and sat with his hands folded, I believe
in prayer. I am sure he was thinking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Jim Cornish, and I would not have interrupted
that honest heart's communion with
its Maker for the value of the ship that had
sunk.</p>

<p>Darkness came down very quickly, and
that we might lose no chance of being seen
by any distant vessel, I lighted the ship's
lantern and hoisted it at the mast-head. I
also lighted the bull's-eye lamp and set it
in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>"Mary," I whispered, "I will make you
up a bed in the bottom of the boat. Whilst
this weather lasts, dearest, we have no
cause to be alarmed by our position. It
will make me happy to see you sleeping,
and be sure that whilst you sleep there will
be watchful eyes near you."</p>

<p>"I will sleep as I am, here, by your side.
I shall rest better so," she answered. "I
could not sleep lying down."</p>

<p>It was too sweet a privilege to forego: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
passed my arm around her and held her
close to me; and she closed her eyes like a
child to please me.</p>

<p>Worn out as I was, enfeebled both intellectually
and physically by the heavy strain
that had been put upon me ever since that
day when I had been ironed by Captain
Coxon's orders, I say&mdash;and I solemnly
believe in the truth of what I am about to
write&mdash;that had it not been for the living
reality of this girl, encircled by my arm, with
her head supported by my shoulder&mdash;had it
not been for the deep love I felt for her,
which localized my thoughts, and, so to say,
humanized them down to the level of our
situation, forbidding them to trespass beyond
the prosaic limits of our danger, of
the precautions to be taken by us, of our
chances of rescue, of the course to be
steered when the wind should fill our sail:
I should have gone mad when the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
came down upon the sea and enveloped our
boat&mdash;a lonely speck on the gigantic world
of water&mdash;in the mystery and fear of darkness.
I know this by recalling the fancy
that for a few moments possessed me in
looking along the water, when I clearly
beheld the outline of a coast, with innumerable
lights twinkling upon it; by the
whirling, dizzy sensation in my head which
followed the extinction of the vision; by
the emotion of wild horror and unutterable
disappointment which overcame me when
I detected the cheat. I pressed my darling
to me, and looked upon her sweet face,
revealed by the light shed by the lantern at
the mast-head, and all my misery left me;
and the delight which the knowledge that
she was my own love and that I held her in
my arms, gave me, fell like an exorcism
upon the demons of my stricken imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
She smiled when I pressed her to my
side and when she saw my face close to
hers, looking at her; but she did not know
then that she had saved me from a fate more
dreadful than death, and that I&mdash;so strong
as I seemed, so earnest as I had shown
myself in my conflicts with fate, so resolutely
as I had striven to comfort her&mdash;had
been rescued from madness by her whom
I had a thousand times pitied for her
helplessness.</p>

<p>She fell asleep at last, and I sat for
nearly two hours motionless, that I should
not awaken her. The steward slept with
his head in his arms, kneeling, a strange,
mad posture. The boatswain sat forward,
with his face turned aft and his arms
folded. I addressed him once, but he did
not answer. Probably I spoke too low for
him to hear, being fearful of waking Mary;
but there was little we had to say. Doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
he found his thoughts too engrossing
to suffer him to talk.</p>

<p>Being anxious to "take a star," as we
say at sea, and not knowing how the time
went, I gently drew out my watch and
found the hour a quarter to eleven. In
replacing the watch I aroused Mary, who
raised her head and looked round her with
eyes that flashed in the lantern light.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she exclaimed, and
bent her head to gaze at me, on which she
recollected herself. "Poor boy!" she said,
taking my hand, "I have kept you supporting
my weight. You were more tired than
I. But it is your turn now. Rest your
head on my shoulder."</p>

<p>"No, it is still your turn," I answered,
"and you shall sleep again presently. But
since you are awake, I will try to find out
where we are. You shall hold the lamp for
me while I make my calculations and
examine the chart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Saying which, I drew out my sextant and
got across the thwarts to the mast, which I
stood up alongside of to lean on, for the
swell, though moderate enough to pass
without notice on a big vessel, lifted and
sunk the boat in such a way as to make
it difficult to stand steady.</p>

<p>I was in the act of raising the sextant to
my eye, when the boatswain suddenly cried,
"Mr. Royle, listen!"</p>

<p>"What do you hear?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Hush! listen now!" he answered, in a
breathless voice.</p>

<p>I strained my ear, but nothing was
audible to me but the wash of the water
against the boat's side.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear it, Mr. Royle?" he
cried, in a kind of agony, holding up his
finger. "Miss Robertson, don't you hear
something?"</p>

<p>There was another interval of silence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mary answered, "I hear a kind of throbbing!"</p>

<p>"It is so!" I exclaimed. "I hear it
now! it is the engines of a steamer!"</p>

<p>"A steamer! Yes! I heard it! where
is she?" shouted the boatswain, and he
jumped on to the thwart on which I stood.</p>

<p>We strained our ears again.</p>

<p>That throbbing sound, as Mary had
accurately described it, closely resembling
the rythmical running of a locomotive
engine heard in the country on a silent
night at a long distance, was now distinctly
audible; but so smooth was the water, so
breathless the night, that it was impossible
to tell how far away the vessel might be;
for so fine and delicate a vehicle of sound
is the ocean in a calm, that, though the
hull of a steamship might be below the
horizon, yet the thumping of her engines
would be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Once more we inclined our ears, holding
our breath as we listened.</p>

<p>"It grows louder!" cries the boatswain.
"Mr. Royle, bend your bull's-eye lamp
to the end o' one o' the oars and swing it
about whilst I dip this mast-head lantern."</p>

<p>Very different was his manner now from
what it had been that morning when the
Russian hove in sight.</p>

<p>I lashed the lamp by the ring of it to an
oar and waved it to and fro. Meanwhile
the boatswain had got hold of the mast-head
halliards, and was running the big
ship's lantern up and down the mast.</p>

<p>"Mary," I exclaimed, "lift up the seat
behind you, and in the left-hand corner you
will find a pistol."</p>

<p>"I have it," she answered, in a few
moments.</p>

<p>"Point it over the stern and fire!" I
cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
She levelled the little weapon and pulled
the trigger, the white flame leapt, and a
smart report followed.</p>

<p>"Listen now!" I said.</p>

<p>I held the oar steady, and the boatswain
ceased to dance the lantern. For the first
few seconds I heard nothing, then my ear
caught the throbbing sound.</p>

<p>"I see her!" cried the boatswain; and
following his finger (my sight being keener
than my hearing) I saw not only the shadow
of a vessel down in the south-west, but the
smoke from her funnel pouring along the
stars.</p>

<p>"Mary," I cried, "fire again!"</p>

<p>She drew the trigger.</p>

<p>"Again!"</p>

<p>The clear report whizzed like a bullet
passed my ears.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the second report a
ball of blue fire shot up into the sky.
Another followed, and another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
A moment after a red light shone clear
upon the sea.</p>

<p>"She sees us!" I cried. "God be
praised! Mary, darling, she sees us!"</p>

<p>I waved the lamp furiously. But there
was no need to wave it any longer. The
red light drew nearer and nearer; the throbbing
of the engines louder and louder, and
the revolutions of the propeller sounded like
a pulse beating through the water.</p>

<p>The shadow broadened and loomed larger.
I could hear the water spouting out of
her side and the blowing off of the safety-valve.</p>

<p>Soon the vessel grew a defined shape
against the stars, and then a voice, thinned
by the distance, shouted, "What light is
that?"</p>

<p>I cried to the boatswain, "Answer, for
God's sake! My voice is weak."</p>

<p>He hollowed his hands and roared back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
"We're shipwrecked seamen adrift in a
quarter-boat!"</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the shadow, and
now it was a long, black hull, a funnel
pouring forth a dense volume of smoke,
spotted with fire-sparks, and tapering masts
and fragile rigging, with the stars running
through them.</p>

<p>"Ease her!"</p>

<p>The sound of the throbbing grew more
measured. We could hear the water as it
was churned up by the screw.</p>

<p>"Stop her!"</p>

<p>The sounds ceased, and the vessel came
looming up slowly, more slowly, until she
stopped.</p>

<p>"What is that?&mdash;a boat?" exclaimed a
strong bass voice.</p>

<p>"Yes!" answered the boatswain. "We've
been shipwrecked; we're adrift in a quarter-boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
"Can you bring her alongside?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>I threw out an oar, but trembled so
violently that it was as much as I could do
to work it. We headed the boat for the
steamer, and rowed towards her. As we
approached I perceived that she was very
long, barque-rigged, and raking, manifestly
a powerful, iron-built, ocean steamer. They
had hung a red light on the forestay, and a
white light over her port quarter, and lights
flitted about her gangway.</p>

<p>A voice sang out, "How many are there
of you?"</p>

<p>The boatswain answered, "Three men
and a lady!"</p>

<p>On this the same voice called, "If you
want help to bring the boat alongside we'll
send to you."</p>

<p>"We'll be alongside in a few minutes,"
returned the boatswain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
But the fact was the vessel had stopped
her engines when further off from us than
we had imagined; being deceived by the
magnitude of her looming hull, which
seemed to stand not a hundred fathoms
away from us and by the wonderful distinctness
of the voice that had spoken us.</p>

<p>I did not know how feeble I had become
until I took the oar, and the violent emotions
excited in me by our rescue now
to be effected after our long and heavy
trials, diminished still the little strength
that was left in me, so that the boat moved
very slowly through the water, and it was
full twenty minutes, starting from the time
when we had shipped the oars, before we
came up with her.</p>

<p>"We'll fling you a rope's end," said a
voice; "look out for it."</p>

<p>A line fell into the boat; the boatswain
caught it and sang out "All fast!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
I looked up the high side of the steamer:
there was a crowd of men assembled round
the gangway, their faces visible in the light
shed not only by our own mast-head lantern
(which was on a level with the steamer's
bulwarks) but by other lanterns which some
of them held. In all this light we, the
occupants of the boat, were to be clearly
viewed from the deck; and the voice that
had first addressed us <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Are you strong enough to get up the
ladder? if not we'll sling you on board."</p>

<p>I answered that if a couple of hands
would come down into the boat so as to
help the lady and a man (who had fallen
imbecile) over the ship's side, the other two
would manage to get on board without
assistance.</p>

<p>On this a short gangway ladder was
lowered, and two men descended and got
into the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
"Take that lady first," I said, pointing
to Mary, but holding on as I spoke to the
boat's mast, for I felt horribly sick and faint,
and knew not, indeed, what was going to
happen to me; and I had to exert all my
power to steady my voice.</p>

<p>They took her by the arms, and watching
the moment when the wash of the swell
brought the boat against the ship's side,
landed her cleverly on the ladder and helped
her on to the deck.</p>

<p>"Bo'sun," I cried huskily, "she ... she
is ... saved ... I am dying, I think....
God bless her! and ... and ... your hand,
mate...."</p>

<p>I remember uttering these incoherent
words and seeing the boatswain spring forward
to catch me. Then my senses left me
with a flash.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p>I remained, as I was afterwards informed,
insensible for four days, during which time
I told and re-told in my delirium the story
of the mutiny and our own sufferings, so
that, as the ship's surgeon assured me, he
became very exactly acquainted with all the
particulars of the <i>Grosvenor's</i> voyage, from
the time of her leaving the English Channel
to the moment of our rescue from the boat,
though I, from whom he learnt the story,
was insensible as I related it. My delirium
even embraced so remote an incident as the
running down of the smack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
When I opened my eyes I found myself
in a small, very comfortable cabin, lying in
a bunk; and being alone, I had no knowledge
of where I was, nor would my memory
give me the slightest assistance. That
every object my eye rested upon was unfamiliar,
and that I was on board a ship,
was all that I knew for certain. What
puzzled me most was the jarring sound
caused by the engines. I could not conceive
what this meant nor what produced
it; and the vessel being perfectly steady, it
was not in my power to realize that I was
being borne over the water.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and lay perfectly still,
striving to master the past and inform myself
of what had become of me; but so
hopelessly muddled was my brain, that had
some unseen person, by way of a joke, told
me in a sepulchral voice that I was dead
and apprehending the things about me only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
by means of my spirit, which had not yet
had time to get out of my body, I should
have believed him; though I don't say that
I should not have been puzzled to reconcile
my very keen appetite and thirst with my
non-existent condition.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the door of the cabin
was opened and a jolly, red-faced man, wearing
a Scotch cap, looked in. Seeing me
with my eyes open, he came forward and
exclaimed in a cheerful <span class="locked">voice&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"All alive O! Staring about you full of
wonderment! Nothing so good as curiosity
in a sick man. Shows that the blood is
flowing."</p>

<p>He felt my pulse, and asked me if I knew
who he was.</p>

<p>I replied that I had never seen him
before.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not my fault," said he;
"for I've been looking at you a pretty tidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
while on and off since we hoisted you out
of the brine.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">'Guid speed an' furder to you, Johnny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guid health, hale han's, an' weather bonnie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May ye ne'er want a stoup o' brany<br /></span>
<span class="i16">To clear your head!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hungry?"</p>

<p>"Very," said I.</p>

<p>"Thirsty?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How do you feel in yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have been trying to find out. I don't
know. I forget who I am."</p>

<p>"Raise your arm and try your muscles."</p>

<p>"I can raise my arm," I said, doing so.</p>

<p>"How's your memory?"</p>

<p>"If you'll give me a hint or two, I'll see."</p>

<p>He looked at me very earnestly and with
much kindness in the expression of his
jovial face, and debated some matter in his
own mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
"I'll send you in some beef-tea," he said,
"by a person who'll be able to do you more
good than I can. But don't excite yourself.
Converse calmly, and don't talk too much."</p>

<p>So saying he went away.</p>

<p>I lay quite still and my memory remained
as helpless as though I had just been born.</p>

<p>After an interval of about ten minutes
the door was again opened and Mary came
in. She closed the door and approached
me, holding a cup of beef-tea in her hand,
but however she had schooled herself to
behave, her resolution forsook her; she put
the cup down, threw her arms round my
neck, and sobbed with her cheek against
mine.</p>

<p>With my recognition of her my memory
returned to me.</p>

<p>"My darling," I cried, in a weak voice,
"is it you indeed! Oh, God is very merciful
to have spared us. I remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
nothing just now; but all has come back to
me with your dear face."</p>

<p>She was too overcome to speak for some
moments, but raising herself presently she
said in broken <span class="locked">tones&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I thought I should never see you again,
never be able to speak to you more. But I
am wicked to give way to my feelings when
I have been told that any excitement must
be dangerous to my darling. Drink this,
now&mdash;no, I will hold the cup to your lips.
Strength has been given me to bear the
sufferings we have gone through, that I may
nurse you and bring you back to health."</p>

<p>I would not let go her hand; but when I
attempted to prop myself up, I found my
elbow would not sustain me; so I lay back
and drank from the cup which she held to
my mouth.</p>

<p>"How long is it," I asked her, "since we
were taken on board this vessel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
"Four days. Do you know that you fell
down insensible in the boat the moment
after I had been carried on to the deck of
this ship? The men crowded around me
and held their lanterns to my face, and
I found that most of them were Scotch
by their exclamations. A woman took
me by the hand to lead me away, but I
refused to move one step until I saw that
you were on board. She told me that you
had fainted in the boatswain's arms, and
others cried out that you were dead. I saw
them bring you up out of the boat, and told
the woman that I must go with you and see
where they put you, and asked if there was
a doctor on board. She said yes, and that
he was that man in the Scotch cap and
greatcoat, who was helping the others to
take you downstairs. I took your poor
senseless hands and cried bitterly over
them, and told the doctor I would go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
my knees to him if he would save your life.
But he was very kind&mdash;very kind and
gentle."</p>

<p>"And you, Mary? I saw you keep up
your wonderful courage to the last."</p>

<p>"I fainted when the doctor took me
away from you," she answered, with one of
her sweet, wistful smiles. "I slept far into
the next day, and I rose quite well yesterday
morning, and have been by your side nearly
ever since. It is rather hard upon me that
your consciousness should have returned
when I had left the cabin for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>I made her turn her face to the light that
I might see her clearly, and found that
though her mental and physical sufferings
had left traces on her calm and beautiful
face, yet on the whole she looked fairly well
in health; her eyes bright, her complexion
clear, and her lips red, with a firm expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
on them. I also took notice that she
was well dressed in a black silk, though
probably I was not good critic enough just
then in such matters to observe that it
fitted her ill, and did no manner of justice
to her lovely shape.</p>

<p>She caught me looking at the dress, and
told me with a smile that it had been lent
to her by a lady passenger.</p>

<p>"Why do you stand?" I said.</p>

<p>"The doctor only allowed me to see you
on condition that I did not stay above five
minutes."</p>

<p>"That is nonsense. I cannot let you go
now you are here. Your dear face gives me
back all the strength I have lost. How
came I to fall down insensible? I am
ashamed of myself! I, a sailor, supposed
to be inured to all kinds of privation, to be
cut adrift from my senses by a shipwreck!
Mary, you are fitter to be a sailor than I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
After this, let me buy a needle and thread,
and advertise for needlework."</p>

<p>"You are talking too much. I shall
leave you."</p>

<p>"You cannot while I hold your hand."</p>

<p>"Am I not stronger than you?"</p>

<p>"In all things stronger, Mary. You
have been my guardian angel. You interceded
for my life with God, and He heard
you when He would not have heard me."</p>

<p>She placed her hand on my mouth.</p>

<p>"You are talking too much, I say. You
reproach yourself for your weakness, but try
to remember what you have gone through:
how you had to baffle the mutineers&mdash;to
take charge of the ship&mdash;to save our lives
from their terrible designs. Remember,
too, that for days together you scarcely
closed your eyes in sleep, that you did the
work of a whole crew during the storm&mdash;dearest,
what you have gone through would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
have broken many a man's heart or driven
him mad. It has left you your own true
self for me to love and cherish whilst God
shall spare us to each other."</p>

<p>She kissed me on the mouth, drew her
hand from mine, and with a smile full of
tender affection left the cabin.</p>

<p>I was vexed to lose her even for a short
time; and still chose to think myself a poor
creature for falling ill and keeping to my
bed, when I might be with her about the
ship and telling the people on board the
story of her misfortunes and beautiful
courage.</p>

<p>It was a mistake of the doctor's to suppose
that <i>her</i> conversation could hurt me.</p>

<p>I had no idea of the time, and stared hard
at the bull's-eye over my head, hoping to discover
by the complexion of the light that it
was early in the day, so that I might again
see Mary before the night came. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
even rash enough to imagine that I had the
strength to rise, and made an effort to get
out of the bunk, which gave me just the
best illustration I could wish that I was as
weak as a baby. So I tumbled back with a
groan of disappointment, and after staring
fixedly at the bull's-eye, I fell asleep.</p>

<p>This sleep lasted some hours. I awoke,
not as I had first awakened from insensibility,
with tremors and bewilderment, but
easily, with a delicious sense of warmth and
rest and renewing vigour in my limbs.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes upon three persons
standing near the bunk; one was Mary, the
other the doctor, and the third a thin,
elderly, sunburnt man, in a white waistcoat
with gold buttons and a blue cloth loose
coat.</p>

<p>The doctor felt my pulse, and letting fall
my hand, said to <span class="locked">Mary&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Now, Miss Robertson, Mr. Royle will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
do. If you will kindly tell the steward
to give you another basin of broth, you will
find our patient able to make a meal."</p>

<p>She kissed her hand to me behind the
backs of the others, and went out with
a beaming smile.</p>

<p>"This is Captain Craik, Mr. Royle,"
continued the doctor, motioning to the
gentleman in the white waistcoat, "commanding
this vessel, the <i>Peri</i>."</p>

<p>I at once thanked him earnestly for his
humanity, and the kindness he was showing
me.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he replied, "I am very pleased
with my good fortune in rescuing so brave a
pair of men as yourself and your boatswain,
and happy to have been the instrument of
saving the charming girl to whom you are
betrothed from the horror of exposure in an
open boat. I have had the whole of your
story from Miss Robertson, and I can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
say that you have acted very heroically and
honourably."</p>

<p>I replied that I was very grateful to him
for his kind words; but I assured him that
I only deserved a portion of his praise.
The man who truly merited admiration was
the boatswain.</p>

<p>"You shall divide the honours," he said,
smiling. "The bo'sun is already a hero.
My crew seem disposed to worship him.
If you have nothing better for him in your
mind, you may hand him over to me. I
know the value of such men now-a-days,
when so much is left to the crimp."</p>

<p>Saying this, he went to the door and
called; and immediately my old companion,
the boatswain, came in. I held out my
hand, and it was clutched by the honest
fellow and held with passionate cordiality.</p>

<p>"Mr. Royle, sir," he exclaimed, in a
faltering voice, "this is a happy moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
for me. There wos a time when I never
thought I should ha' seen you alive agin,
and it went to my heart, and made me
blubber like any old woman when I thought
o' your dyin' arter all the trouble you've seen,
and just when, if I may be so bold as to say
it, you might be hopin' to marry the brave,
high-sperrited gell as you saved from
drownin', and who belongs to you by the
will o' God Almighty. Captain Craik, sir&mdash;I
speak by your favour, and ax pardon for
the liberty&mdash;this gen'man and me has seen
some queer starts together since we fust
shipped aboard the <i>Grosvenor</i> in the West
Hindie Docks, and," he cried with vehemence,
"I'd sooner ha' lost the use o' my
right arm an' leg&mdash;yes, an' you may chuck
my right eye in along with them&mdash;than Mr.
Royle should ha' died just as he was agoin'
to live properly and set down on the bench
o' matrimony an' happiness with a bold and
handsome wife!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
This eloquent harangue he delivered with
a moist eye, addressing us all three in turn.
I thanked him heartily for what he had
said, but limited my reply to this: for
though I could have complimented him
more warmly than he had praised me, I
considered that it would be more becoming
to hold over all mutual admiration and you-and-me
glorification until we should be
alone.</p>

<p>I observed that he wore a velvet waistcoat,
and carried a shiny cloth cap with
a brilliant peak, very richly garnished with
braid; and as such articles of raiment could
only emanate from the forecastle, I concluded
that they were gifts from the crew,
and that Captain Craik had reason in
thinking that the boatswain had become
a hero.</p>

<p>The doctor shortly after this motioned
him to go, whereon he gave a shipshape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
salute, by tweaking an imaginary curl on his
forehead, and went away.</p>

<p>I now asked what had become of the
steward. Captain Craik answered that the
man was all right so far as his health went;
that he wandered about the decks very
harmlessly, smiling in the faces of the men,
and seldom speaking.</p>

<p>"One peculiarity of the poor creature,"
said he, "is that he will not taste any kind
of food but what is served out to the crew.
I have myself tried him with dishes from
the saloon table, but could not induce him
to touch a mouthful. The first time I tried
him in this way he fell from me as though I
had offered to cut his throat; the perspiration
poured from his forehead, and he eyed
me with looks of the utmost horror and
aversion. Can you account for this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied. "The steward was
in the habit of serving out the ship's stores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to the crew of the <i>Grosvenor</i>. He rather
sided with the captain, and tried to make
the best of what was outrageously bad.
When the men mutinied they threatened to
hang him if he touched any portion of the
cuddy stores, and I dare say they would
have executed their threat. He was rather
a coward before he lost his reason, and the
threat affected him violently. I myself
never could induce him to taste any other
food than the ship's rotten stores whilst the
men remained in the vessel, and I dare say
the memory of the threat still lives in his
broken mind."</p>

<p>"Thanks for your explanation," said the
doctor, "I shall sleep the better for it; for,
upon my word, the man's unnatural dislike
of good food&mdash;of <i>entrées</i>, man, and curried
fowl and roast goose, for I tried him myself&mdash;has
kept me awake bothering my head
to understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
"May I ask what vessel this is?" I said,
addressing Captain Craik.</p>

<p>"The <i>Peri</i>, of Glasgow, homeward-bound
from Jamaica," he answered.</p>

<p>"I know the ship now, sir. She belongs
to the &mdash;&mdash; Line."</p>

<p>"Quite right. We shall hope to put you
ashore in seven days hence. It is curious
that I should have known Mr. Robertson,
your lady's father. I called upon him a
few years since in Liverpool, on business,
and had a long conversation with him.
Little could I have dreamt that his end
would be so sad, and that it should be
reserved for me to rescue his daughter from
an open boat, in mid-Atlantic!"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," I exclaimed, "no one but I can
ever know the terrible trials this poor girl
has passed through. She has been twice
shipwrecked within three weeks; she has
experienced all the horrors of a mutiny;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
she has lost her father under circumstances
which would have killed many girls with
grief; she has been held in terror of her life,
and yet never once has her noble courage
flagged, her splendid spirit failed her."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Captain Craik, "I have
read her character in her story and in her
way of relating it. You are to be congratulated
on having won the love of a
woman whose respect alone would do a
man honour."</p>

<p>"He deserves what he has got," said the
doctor, laughing. "Findings keepings."</p>

<p>"I did find her and I mean to keep her,"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, you have picked up a fortune,"
observed Captain Craik. "It is not every
man who finds a shipwreck a good investment."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her fortune," I
answered. "She did indeed tell me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
her father was a ship-owner; but I have
asked no questions, and only know her as
Mary Robertson, a sweet, brave girl, whom
I love, and, please God, mean to marry,
though she possessed nothing more in the
world than the clothes I found her in."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"You're not a sailor, doctor," remarked
Captain Craik, drily.</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir, you'll not tell me that
a gold pound's not better than a silver sixpence?"
cried the doctor. "Did you never
sing this song?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">'Awa wi' your witchcraft o' beauty's alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slender bit beauty you grasp in your arms;<br /></span>

<p>Is not an heiress better than a poor
wench?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
"I don't see how your simile of the
pound and the sixpence applies," answered
Captain Craik. "A good woman is a good
woman all the world over, and a gift that
every honest man will thank God for.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

</div></div>

<p>That's one of Robbie's too, doctor, and
I commend your attention to the whole
song as a wholesome purge."</p>

<p>As the conversation was rather too personal
to be much to my liking, I was very
glad when it was put an end to by Mary
coming in with a basin of soup for me.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p>Thanks to my darling's devotion, to her
unwearied attentions, to her foresight and
care of me, I was strong enough to leave
my cabin on the third day following my
restoration to consciousness.</p>

<p>During that time many inquiries were
made after my health by the passengers,
and Mary told me that the greatest
curiosity prevailed fore and aft to see
me. So misfortune had made a little
ephemeral hero of me, and this, perhaps,
was one stroke of compensation which I
should have been very willing to dispense
with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The second officer of the ship, a man of
about my height and build, had very kindly
placed his wardrobe at my disposal, but all
that I had chosen to borrow from him was
some linen, which, indeed, I stood greatly
in need of; but my clothes, though rather
the worse for salt water, were, in my
opinion, quite good enough for me to wear
until I should be able to buy a new outfit
ashore.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, then, on the third day I
rose and leisurely dressed myself, and then
sat waiting for Mary, whose arm to lean on
I preferred to any one's else.</p>

<p>She came to the cabin presently, and
when she had entered I folded her in my
arms with so deep a feeling of happiness
and love and gratitude in me, that I had no
words to speak to her.</p>

<p>It was when I released her that she said&mdash;"Since
God has heard our prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
dearest, and mercifully preserved us from
death, shall we thank Him now that we are
together, and say one prayer for my dear
father, who, I firmly believe, looks down
upon us and has still the power to bless
us?"</p>

<p>I took her hand and we knelt together,
and first thanking her for reminding me of
my bounden duty, I lifted up my heart to
Almighty God, Father of all men, who had
guarded us amid our perils, who had
brought us to the knowledge and love of
Him and of each other, by the lesson of
hard trials and sorrowful privation.</p>

<p>And I would ask you to believe that I do
not relate such circumstances as these from
any ostentatious wish to parade my piety,
of which God knows I have not so large a
store that I need be vain of showing it; but
that I may in some poor fashion justify
many good men in my own profession who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
because they are scandalised by persons
among us that are bad, are confounded with
these by people ashore who imagine the
typical sailor to be a loose, debauched
fellow, with his mouth full of bad language
and his head full of drink. I say earnestly
that this is not so; that a large and
generous soul animates many sailors; that
they love God, pray to Him, and in many
ways too rough, maybe, to commend them to
fastidious piety, but not surely the less
honest for the roughness, strive to act up to
a just standard of goodness; and that even
among the bad&mdash;bad, I mean, through the
looseness of their morals and the insanity
of their language&mdash;there is often found a
hidden instinctive religion and veneration
and fear of God not to be discovered in the
classes ashore to which you may parallel
them. Nor, indeed, do I understand how
this can fail to be; for no familiarity with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the mighty deep can lessen its ever-appealing
grandeur to them as a symbol of
heavenly power and majesty; and the
frequent fear of their lives in which sailors
go&mdash;the fury of tempests, the darkness of
stormy nights, the fragility of the ship in
comparison with the mountainous waves
which menace her, the horror of near and
iron coasts&mdash;I say that such things, which
are daily presented to them, must inevitably
excite and sustain contemplations which
very few events that happen on shore are
calculated to arouse in the minds of the
ignorant classes with whom such sailors as
I am speaking of are on a level.</p>

<p>When I quitted the cabin, supported by
Mary, I found myself in a very spacious
saloon, most handsomely furnished and
decorated, and striking me the more by the
contrast it offered to the plain and small
interior of the <i>Grosvenor's</i> cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
The table was being prepared for lunch:
smartly dressed stewards and under-stewards
trotted to and fro; there were flowers on
the table, vases of gold fish swinging from
the deck, a rich thick carpet underfoot,
comfortable and handsome sofas; a pianoforte
stood against the mizzen-mast, which
was covered with a mahogany skin and
gilded; two rows of lamps went the length
of the saloon; and what with the paintings
on the cabin doors, the curtains, the rich
brasswork about the spacious skylights, the
bright sunshine streaming in upon the
whole scene and kindling a brilliance in the
polished woodwork, the crystal on the table,
the looking-glasses at the fore end of the
saloon&mdash;I fairly paused with amazement,
scarcely conceiving it possible that this
airy, sunshiny, sumptuous drawing-room
was actually the interior of a ship, and
that we were on the sea, steaming at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
rate of so many miles an hour towards
England.</p>

<p>There were a couple of well-dressed
women sewing or doing some kind of
needlework and conversing on one of the
sofas, and on another sofa a gentleman sat
reading. These, with the stewards, were
all the people in the saloon.</p>

<p>The gentleman and the ladies looked at
us when we approached, and all three of
them rose.</p>

<p>The ladies came and shook hands with
Mary, who introduced me to them; but I
forget their names.</p>

<p>They began to praise me; the gentleman
struck in, and asked permission to shake me
by the hand. They had heard my story: it
was a beautiful romance; in short, they
overpowered me with civilities, and made
me so nervous that I had scarcely the heart
to go on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Of course it was all very kindly meant;
but then what were my exploits? Nothing
to make money out of, nothing to justify
my appearance on the boards of a London
theatre, nothing to furnish a column of wild
writing to a newspaper, nothing to merit
even the honour of a flattering request from
a photographic company. I very exactly
knew what I <i>had</i> done, and was keenly
alive to the absurdity of any heroizing
process.</p>

<p>However, I had sense enough to guess
that what blushing honours were thrust
upon me would be very short-lived. Who
does not thank God at some time or other
in his life that there <i>is</i> such a thing as
oblivion?</p>

<p>So we went on deck; I overhearing one
of the ladies talk some nonsense about her
never having read or heard of anything
more deliciously romantic and exciting than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the young sailor rescuing a pretty girl from
a wreck and falling in love with her.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Mary?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>"Was it romantic?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And exciting?"</p>

<p>"Dreadfully."</p>

<p>"And did they live happily ever afterwards?"</p>

<p>"We shall see."</p>

<p>"Darling, it <i>is</i> romantic, and it <i>is</i> exciting,
to us, and to no one else. Yes, very
romantic now that I come to think of it;
but all has come about so gradually that I
have never thought of the romance that
runs through our story. What time did we
have to think? Mutineers out of Wapping
are no polite garnishers to a love story; and
romance must be pretty stoutly bolt-roped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
not to be blown to smithereens by a hurricane."</p>

<p>There were a number of passengers on
deck, men, women, and children, and when
I ran my eye along the ship (the <i>Grosvenor</i>
would have made a neat long-boat for
her) and observed her dimensions, I thought
that a city might have gone to sea in her
without any inconvenience arising from
overcrowding. In a word, she was a magnificent
Clyde-built iron boat of some four
thousand tons burden, and propelled by
eight hundred horse-power engines; her
decks white as a yacht's, a shining awning
forward and aft; a short yellow funnel,
towering masts and broad yards, and embodying
every conceivable "latest improvement"
in compasses, capstans, boat-lowering
gear, blocks, gauges, logs, windlass, and
the rest of it. She was steaming over a
smooth sea and under a glorious blue sky at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the rate of thirteen knots, or nearly fifteen
miles an hour. Cool draughts of air circled
under the awning and fanned my hollow
cheeks, and invigorated and refreshed me
like cordials.</p>

<p>The captain was on deck when we
arrived, and the moment he saw me he
came forward and shook my hand, offering
me many kindly congratulations on my
recovery; and with his own hands placed
chairs for me and Mary near the mizzen-mast.
Then the chief officer approached,
and most, indeed I think all, of the passengers;
and I believe that had I been as
cynical as old Diogenes I should have been
melted into a hearty faith in human nature
by the sympathy shown me by these kind
people.</p>

<p>They illustrated their goodness best, perhaps,
by withdrawing, after a generous salutation,
and resuming their various employments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
or discussions, so as to put me at
my ease. The doctor and the chief officer
stayed a little while talking to us; and then
presently the tiffin-bell rang, and all the
passengers went below, the captain having
previously suggested that I should remain
on deck, so as to get the benefit of the air,
and that he would send a steward to wait
upon me. Mary would not leave my side;
and the officer in charge taking his station
on the bridge before the funnel, we, to my
great satisfaction, had the deck almost to
ourselves.</p>

<p>"You predicted, Mary," I said, "that
our lives would be spared. Your dream has
come true."</p>

<p>"Yes; I knew my father would not
deceive me. Would to God he had been
spared!"</p>

<p>"Yet God has been very good to us,
Mary. What a change is this, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
deck of the <i>Grosvenor</i>&mdash;the seas beating
over us, the ship labouring as though at
any moment she must go to pieces&mdash;ourselves
fagged to death, and each of us in
our hearts for hours and hours beholding
death face to face. I feel as though I
had no right to be alive after so much
hard work. It is a violation of natural
laws and an impertinent triumphing of
vitality over the whole forces of Nature."</p>

<p>"But you are alive, dear, and that is all I
care about."</p>

<p>I pressed her hand, and after looking
around me asked her if she knew whether
this vessel went direct to Glasgow.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you any friends there?"</p>

<p>"None. But I have friends here. The
captain has asked me to stay with his
wife until I hear from home."</p>

<p>"To whom shall you write?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
"To my aunt in Leamington. She will
come to Glasgow and take me home. And
you?"</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>I looked at her and smiled.</p>

<p>"I! Why, your question puts a matter
into my head that I must think over."</p>

<p>"You are not strong enough to think. If
you begin to think I shall grow angry."</p>

<p>"But I must think, Mary."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I must think how I am to get to
London, and what I am to do when I
get there."</p>

<p>"When we were on the <i>Grosvenor</i>," she
said, "you did all the thinking for me,
didn't you? And now that we are on the
<i>Peri</i> I mean to do all the thinking for
you. But I need not say that. I have
thought my thoughts out. I have done
with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
"Look here, Mary, I am going to be
candid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here comes one of the stewards to
interrupt you."</p>

<p>A very civil fellow came with a tray,
which he placed on the skylight, and stood
by to wait on us. I told him he need not
stay, and, addressing Mary, I <span class="locked">exclaimed&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"This recalls our farewell feast on the
<i>Grosvenor</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes; and there is the boatswain watching
us, as if he would like to come to
us again and congratulate us on having
found each other out. Do catch his eye,
dear, and wave your hand. He dare not
come here."</p>

<p>I waved my hand to him and he
flourished his cap in return, and so did
three or four men who were around him.</p>

<p>"I am going&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"You will eat your lunch first," she interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
"But why will you not listen?"</p>

<p>"Because I have made my arrangements."</p>

<p>"But I wish to speak of myself, dear."</p>

<p>"I am speaking of you&mdash;my arrangements
concern you&mdash;and me."</p>

<p>I looked at her uneasily, for somehow
the sense of my own poverty came home to
me very sharply, and I had a strong disinclination
to hear what my foolish pride
might smart under as a mortification.</p>

<p>She read my thoughts in my eyes; and
blushing, yet letting me see her sweet face,
she said in a low voice, "I thought we were
to be married?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. It is my dearest wish, Mary.
I have told you I love you. It would break
up my life to lose you now."</p>

<p>"You shall not lose me&mdash;but neither will
I lose you. I shall never release you more."</p>

<p>"Mary, <i>do</i> let me speak my thoughts out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
I am very poor. The little that I had has
gone down in the <i>Grosvenor</i>. I could not
marry you as I am. I could not offer you
the hand of a pauper. Let me tell you my
plans. I shall write, on reaching Glasgow,
to the owners of the <i>Grosvenor</i>, relate the
loss of the ship, and ask for payment of the
wages that are due to me. With this
money I will travel to London and go to
work at once to obtain a berth on another
ship. Perhaps, when the owners of the
<i>Grosvenor</i> hear my story, they will give me
a post on board one of their other vessels.
At all events I must hope for the best. I
will work very hard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, I cannot listen!" she exclaimed,
impetuously. "You are going to
tell me that you will work very hard to
become captain and save a little money;
and you will then say that several years
must pass before your pride will suffer you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
to think yourself in a proper position to
make me your wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was going to say that."</p>

<p>"Oh, where is your clever head which
enabled you to triumph over the mutineers?
Has the shipwreck served you as it has the
poor steward?"</p>

<p>"My darling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you to work twenty years, what
money could you save out of this poor profession
of the sea that would justify your
pride&mdash;your cruel pride?"</p>

<p>I was about to speak.</p>

<p>"What money could you save that would
be of service when you know that I am
rich, when you know that what is mine is
yours?"</p>

<p>"Not much," said I.</p>

<p>"Would you have loved me the less had
you known me to be poor? Would you not
have risked your life to save mine though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
had been a beggar? You loved me because&mdash;because
I am Mary Robertson; and I
love you because you are Edward Royle&mdash;dear
to me for your own dear sake, for my
poor dead father's sake, because of my love
for you. Would you go away and leave me
because you are too proud to make us both
happy? I will give you all I have&mdash;I will
be a beggar and you shall be rich that you
need not leave me. Oh, do not speak of
being poor! Who is poor that acts as you
have done? Who is poor that can enrich
a girl's heart as you have enriched mine?"</p>

<p>She had raised her voice unconsciously,
and overhearing herself, as it were, she
stopped on a sudden, and bowed her head
with a sob.</p>

<p>"Mary," I whispered, "I will put my
pride away. Let no man judge me wrongly.
I talk idly&mdash;God knows how idly&mdash;when I
speak of leaving you. Yes, I could leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
you&mdash;but at what cost? at what cost to us
both? What you have said&mdash;that I loved
you as Mary Robertson&mdash;is true. I know
in my own heart that my love cannot dishonour
us&mdash;that it cannot gain nor lose by
what the future may hold in store for me
with you, dear one, as my wife."</p>

<p>"Now you are my own true sailor boy!"
was all she said.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I began this story on the sea, and I desire
to end it on the sea; and though another
yarn, which should embrace my arrival at
Glasgow, my introduction to Mary's aunt,
my visit to Leamington, my marriage, and
divers other circumstances of an equally
personal nature, could easily be spun to
follow this&mdash;yet the title of this story must
limit the compass of it, and with the
"Wreck of the <i>Grosvenor</i>" my tale should
have had an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
And yet I should be doing but poor
justice to the faithful and beautiful nature
of my dear wife, if I did not tell you that
the plans which she had unfolded to me,
and which I have made to appear as though
they only concerned myself, included the
boatswain and the poor steward. For both
a provision was contemplated which I knew
her too well to doubt that she had the
power to make, or that she would forget: a
provision that, on the one hand, would bring
the boatswain alongside of us even in our
own home, and make him independent of
his calling, which, to say the least, considering
the many years he had been to sea,
had served him but ill, and still offered him
but a very scurvy outlook; whilst, on the
other hand, it would enable the steward to
support himself and his wife and child,
without in the smallest degree taxing those
unfortunate brains which we could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
hope the shipwreck had not irreparably
damaged.</p>

<p>Thus much, and this bit of a yarn is
spun.</p>

<p>And now I ask myself, is it worth the
telling? Well, however it goes as a piece
of work, it may teach a lesson: that good
sailors may be made bad, and bad sailors
may be made outrageous, and harmless men
may be converted into criminals by the
meanness of shipowners. Every man knows,
thanks to one earnest, eloquent, and indefatigable
voice that has been raised among
us, what this country thinks of the rascals
who send rotten ships to sea. And it is
worth while to acquaint people with another
kind of rottenness that is likewise sent to
sea, which in its way is as bad as rotten
timbers&mdash;a rottenness which is even less
excusable, inasmuch as it costs but a trifling
sum of money to remedy, than rotten hulls:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
I mean rotten food.</p>

<p>Sailors have not many champions, because
I think their troubles and wrongs are not
understood. You must live and suffer their
lives to know their lives. Go aloft with
them, man the pumps with them, eat their
biscuit and their pork, and drink their water
with them; lodge with crimps along with
them; be of their nature, and experience
their shore-going temptations, the harpies
in trousers and petticoats who prey upon
them, who drug them and strip them.</p>

<p>And however deficient a man may be in
those qualifications of mind which go to the
making of popular novels, I hope no person
will charge such a writer with impertinence
for drawing a quill on behalf of a
race of men to whom Britain owes the
greatest part of her wealth and prosperity,
who brave death, who combat the elements,
who lead in numerous instances the lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
mongrel dogs, who submit, with few murmurs
that ever reach the shore-going ear, to
privations which blanch the cheek to read,
that our tables and our homes may be
abundantly furnished, our banking balances
large, and our national importance supreme.</p>
